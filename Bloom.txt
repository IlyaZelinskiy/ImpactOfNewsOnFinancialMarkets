India’s Environment Ministry has almost halved the time it takes to clear projects, cheering companies hit by the pandemic and worrying green activists concerned the increased pace may come at a cost. It took an average of 84 days to clear a project in 2021, compared with 162 days the year before, according to data shared by the ministry. That’s a result of cutting down needless processes and setting timelines for assessment panels, according to Rameshwar Prasad Gupta, the top bureaucrat in the ministry who took charge last year.

Singapore’s home price growth slowed in the second quarter after virus restrictions deterred new launches and limited the number of people who could view apartments. Private property values rose 0.8% from the previous quarter, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority data released on Friday. That’s lower than the 0.9% flash estimates and less than the 3.3% growth in the first quarter. Enjoying Bloomberg Wealth? To read more articles based on your personal financial goals, answer these 3 questions that will tailor your reading experience. It’s the first time that home value has slowed in five quarters. Singapore’s property market has been sizzling, with both prices of public and luxury homes hitting records. But since May, sales have eased after the government imposed a month-long lockdown-like order that limited apartment viewings. After curbs were relaxed in June, analysts had expected demand to pick up again. But a fresh round of restrictions imposed this week is set to further dampen the frenzy. “Private residential property prices are expected to continue to expand, but at a modest pace, which will lead to a 5% to 8% yoy growth for the whole of this year,” said Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at APAC Realty Ltd. “The good news from this slower price growth is that the policy risk of more cooling measures is deflated.”

What keeps breaking the buck, is engaged in financial transformation, and keeps on growing?The stablecoin market. The value of the top four stablecoins has surpassed $100 billion in the space of four years, and the coins — which trade on a blockchain but attempt to maintain a one-for-one peg with fiat currencies — now form an integral part of the crypto ecosystem, often acting as the collateral behind DeFi and enabling transfers between crypto exchanges. But as the market grows, it’s also coming under increased scrutiny in part because it’s still unclear how stablecoin issuers are maintaining their pegs. Most of the criticism has so far been directed at Tether, which claims that its tokens are 100% backed by reserves, though it has released few details of what those are exactly. If Tether’s account of its reserves is accurate, then it’s  now a massive player in the commercial paper market which has historically been dominated by large investors such as regulated money market funds (MMFs). This is the reason why JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Josh Younger describes stablecoins as being “the primary interaction point between the crypto-native and traditional financial systems through their reserve funds.” The suggestion is that if stablecoins were to experience disruption, it could reverberate into financial markets through the commercial paper channel, again depending on what issuers hold:  The definition of shadow banks is notoriously fuzzy, but it typically includes non-regulated entities engaged in maturity or liquidity transformation — that is securing short-term funds to invest in longer-term assets, or converting illiquid assets into more easily spendable money. On that basis, stablecoins could well be taking questionable reserve assets and converting them into stable digital cash.This isn’t a problem as long as the stablecoin market avoids huge bouts of redemptions. So far that has been the case, even in the sharp crypto sell-off in May. That’s somewhat surprising given that — by Younger’s calculations — the top four coins have ‘broken the buck’ (i.e. dipped below their peg) with some regularity; having spent the past 30% to 40% of the past three months trading below par. But an unexpected disruption risks causing problems for exchanges and issuers which provide the coins. That in turn could feed into the traditional financial system through the key funding market which is commercial paper, and again raises questions of  financial stability given that stablecoin issuers are unregulated. That’s one reason why officials at the Federal Reserve have been talking about stablecoins, with Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren recently keying in on their resemblance to traditional “but maybe riskier” prime money market funds.Back to Younger:

A former trader at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit told a federal jury in Chicago that he learned how to manipulate the price of precious metals from two more senior traders in the bank’s New York office, John Pacilio and Edward Bases. Harnaik Lakhan said he used Merrill’s internal computer system to watch Pacilio and Bases, who are on trial for alleged spoofing, issue buy and sell orders they didn’t intend to be filled, pushing prices up or down to make it profitable for orders they wanted to execute. Lakhan, who agreed to cooperate with the government to avoid prosecution, said he began using the same techniques from his office in London.

The world’s biggest platinum miners are ramping up plans to build renewable energy plants to free them from power outages that have plagued South Africa for more than a decade and to reduce their carbon footprint. Sibanye Stillwater Ltd., the No. 1 platinum miner, Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and Anglo American Platinum Ltd. said they plan to scale up solar and wind farms for their own use to cut reliance on state-owned utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., some of whose aging coal-fired plants have failed to keep up with electricity demand.

President Joe Biden said he believes the surge in U.S. inflation is temporary and that he has told Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that he respects the central bank’s independence. Biden said Monday at the White House that recent price increases are “temporary,” countering Republican arguments that the president’s economic spending plans would cause inflation to spiral out of control. But he also emphasized that he wouldn’t interfere with the central bank’s policies: “As I made clear to Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve when we met recently, the Fed is independent. It should take whatever steps it deems necessary to support a strong and durable economic recovery.”  Biden says "unchecked inflation over the long term would pose a real challenge to our economy" but adds he's "confident that isn't what we're seeing today" pic.twitter.com/FDGUKGBpmc The U.S. saw the largest surge in consumer prices in more than 12 years last month, with a Labor Department gauge rising 5.4% compared to one year ago. The House Republicans’ campaign arm targeted vulnerable Democrats with online ads around the July 4 holiday decrying price increases for “burgers, buns, propane, gas.” A significant portion of the recent inflation is tied to sectors experiencing parts shortages or surging demand stemming from the economy’s reopening, including cars, hospitality and lumber -- a point stressed by Biden in his remarks. Read more: Schumer Sets Deadlines on Infrastructure and Budget Talks  Biden’s speech also comes at a critical juncture in the debate over his $4 trillion economic plan. The bipartisan group authoring a $579 billion infrastructure package is rushing to complete its work before an expected test vote on Wednesday. The deadline is also intended to force Democrats to rally around the $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that contains many of the president’s social spending priorities. “If your primary concern right now is inflation, you should be even more enthusiastic about this plan,” Biden said, arguing that the fiscal boost would help new businesses, increasing competition and driving down prices. Meanwhile, the administration is concerned that stalled vaccination rates in the U.S. could allow variant strains of the coronavirus to spread and hinder the nation’s economic recovery. — With assistance by Mario Parker

Inter Pipeline Ltd. is evaluating a formal revised C$8.6 billion ($6.7 billion) offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP to buy Canada’s fourth-largest midstream company after rival suitor Pembina Pipeline Corp. said it wouldn’t raise its own bid for the company.

Opioid maker Johnson & Johnson and three drug distributors are expected to disclose this week the final terms of a $26 billion settlement for thousands of lawsuits accusing them of fueling a public-health crisis, according to people familiar with the deal.After years of negotiations with five states, the companies are poised to make the announcement Wednesday, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing closed-door talks. Along with J&J, the proposed settlement includes McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. More than 40 states are likely to sign onto the deal -- others are expected to reject it in favor of moving ahead with existing court cases already set for trial, the people said. The agreement likely removes a major overhang for companies seeking to end legal liabilities from their role in the opioid epidemic, analysts say. McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen already indicated in regulatory filings they expect to pay $21 billion, and J&J would pay $5 billion. What’s new is each state also has the option to accept just the J&J offer or the combined distributors’ proposal, and the companies will pay bonuses to states for for how many of their local governments sign up, the people said.

Portland, Ore. (AP) -- The monstrous wildfire burning in Oregon has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California. The fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.

Fresh signs of a cash crunch at China Evergrande Group sent shares and bonds of the world’s most indebted developer to new lows on Tuesday, stoking fears of broader market contagion. The property giant’s stock tumbled to the lowest level since April 2017, extending its two-day loss to 25%. Several of Evergrande’s local and offshore bonds sank to records, with its dollar note due 2025 falling to as low as 54 cents.

GlobalFoundries Inc., a chipmaker owned by an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, is sticking with its plan for an initial public offering next year, according to Chief Executive Officer Tom Caulfield.Reports that GlobalFoundries is the subject of a takeover bid by Intel Corp. are speculation, he said.“There’s nothing there in that discussion,” Caulfield said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Because the chipmaker is moving toward a share sale, “you can expect a lot of speculation to take place,” he said. Intel has studied the feasibility of buying U.S.-based GlobalFoundries, people familiar with the matter said last week, asking not to be identified because deliberations are private. But no formal takeover approach has been made to GlobalFoundries owner Mubadala Investment Co. and the two sides are not engaged in active talks, the people said.

The recent selloff in stocks set to benefit most from an improving economy has gone too far and a reversal is imminent, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic. The unwinding of the so-called reflation trade accelerated on Monday with the delta variant of the coronavirus quickly spreading and concerns flaring that the U.S. is reaching peak economic growth. Traders have been piling into growth sectors such as technology that are viewed as safe havens. But Kolanovic sees further gains in those value names that benefit from faster inflation as the global economy recovers from the pandemic.

International monitors are watching Iran’s fast-expanding nuclear program with growing alarm, as Tehran refuses to extend an expired inspections pact and insists the experts must trust that it’s accurately documenting uranium-enrichment activities. Iran claims it’s still preserving data captured by International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring equipment, the agency’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro. But officials won’t give his investigators access to it until Iran concludes stalled talks with world powers to restore a broader 2015 agreement that lifted sanctions.

The U.S., U.K. and their allies formally attributed the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with the Chinese government and accused Beijing’s leadership of a broad array of “malicious cyber activities,” escalating last week’s tensions between the White House and China. The group of nations said Monday that the Chinese government has been the mastermind behind a series of malicious ransomware, data theft and cyber-espionage attacks against public and private entities, including the sprawling Microsoft Exchange hack earlier this year.

Motiva Enterprises LLC is eying the revival of a multibillion-dollar expansion project at its Texas Gulf Coast refinery in 2023 that would produce petrochemicals used to make everything from plastic water bottles to grocery bags. Engineering and excavation work had already been done before the project was halted nearly two years ago. Now, Saudi Aramco’s U.S. refining arm is considering reactivating the expansion, minus an ethane cracker, which it no longer needs, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.

London’s Heathrow airport was thronged with travelers Monday as the U.K. eased travel curbs -- but pre-holiday enthusiasm was replaced with anger for some after last-minute rule changes added unexpected complications to their trip. While fully vaccinated tourists headed for the Mediterranean were cheered by the removal of quarantine requirements on their return, people bound for France hit out at a decision late Friday that means they’ll still need to self-isolate.

She said she was raped by one of the most powerful men on Wall Street. Now he says she professed her love during a years-long affair -- and that he was later extorted for millions. The private-equity billionaire Leon Black on Monday offered a formal rebuttal -- at times in astonishing detail -- to allegations leveled by a former model from Russia named Guzel Ganieva. Black vigorously denied Ganieva’s allegation that he assaulted her, instead admitting to an affair in a New York state court filing, and saying he used “extremely poor judgment.”

More than 15 months after the last normal commute, the City of London can officially get back to the office today. But has it? To try to measure any changes our photographers documented some of the City’s pivotal locations a week ago, and then returned to the same locations this morning to see what, if anything, had shifted. Cheerleaders for the office, look away now. From London Bridge to King’s Cross, the crowds remain  stubbornly low. Queues for takeaway coffees -- that staple of the morning rush -- were brief. Watling Street, a popular thoroughfare lined with shops and casual eateries, saw little extra custom at lunchtime. ``Today has been quieter than normal,’’ said James Leahy, owner of the Burrito Joe food stand in the financial district. ``I haven't noticed an uptake of people around the City. We aren't expecting it to be busier until September.’’ The reluctance of commuters to return is understandable. Even as the government lifts restrictions, cases are surging, disrupting workplaces across the U.K. with hundreds of thousands of people being advised to self-isolate, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Stellantis NV will operate one fewer shift at its Vauxhall van plant in Luton, England, this week to protect its more than 1,500 workers. A Transport for London spokesman said the London underground service was continuing to have issues due to staff shortages. Pimlico station was closed all morning while there are delays on the Central and Metropolitan lines due to a lack of staff.The immediate operational impact is less severe on finance firms given how much white-collar work can be done remotely. But that is also dampening appetite for a return to the office. Some 40% of British workers said that a strict return to pre-pandemic office norms would hinder their performance, according to a nationally representative survey of 2,069 people conducted by Theta Global Advisors. Monday’s return to the City of London was certainly lackluster. See if you can spot the difference between today and last week: Monday, July 12. Monday, July 19. Monday, July 12.  Monday, July 19.  Monday, July 12.  Monday, July 19.  Monday, July 12.  Monday, July 19.  Monday, July 12.  Monday, July 19.  Monday, July 12.  Monday, July 19.  Monday, July 12.  Monday, July 19.  Monday, July 12.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government pledged to upgrade warning systems following fierce criticism that Germany’s emergency alerts failed as flooding killed over 160 people.

Kansas City Southern investors are right to worry that the Biden administration’s tougher stance on antitrust enforcement may signal trouble for the company’s $34 billion plan to sell itself to  Canadian National Railway Co. On July 9, President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at curbing abuses of pricing power in consolidated industries. The directive is broad, targeting sectors including agricultural-equipment makers and banks in an apparent attempt to signal that the shift in tone goes  far beyond the technology sector that’s borne the  brunt of public antitrust criticism. It’s still notable that railroads were included in the order. Seven providers dominate the industry, and the physical nature of rail infrastructure makes it more difficult for shippers to price-shop from one company to the next. But while most of the other sectors mentioned in the order have seen a rash of deals in recent years, there hasn’t been a sustained effort to win regulatory backing for a major combination of two North American railroads since the 1990s. Until now, that is. Kansas City Southern first agreed to sell itself to  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. but transferred its allegiance to Canadian National after the latter made a higher offer. The  Surface Transportation Board (STB) has primary and independent oversight for the railroad industry, though the U.S. Department of Justice has asserted a “statutory right to intervene” in major merger proceedings and has already raised  objections to aspects of the deal. Because Canadian National directly competes with Kansas City Southern in certain markets and the two railroads overlap somewhat, the STB has said the acquirer must meet tougher rules adopted in 2001 that require it to prove a transaction enhances competition and serves the public interest. But the “public interest” standard is fuzzy and untested. Canadian National has touted the benefits of connecting the U.S., Canada, and Mexico with one railroad and the prospect of luring traffic away from more environmentally problematic trucks. But in the executive order, the Biden administration proposed adding another dimension to the public-interest consideration: It wants the STB to factor in how railroads have performed when it comes to respecting  Amtrak passenger trains’ priority right of way. Amtrak grades the railroads based on how many delays they cause for its trains. Although Canadian National showed substantial improvement in 2020 to earn a B+, the company has had a prickly relationship with Amtrak, and its four-year average is just a D+. Only  Norfolk Southern Corp. scored worse. Kansas City Southern’s share price is now about $50 below the implied value of Canadian National’s cash-and-stock offer—the biggest gap for any pending takeover in North America—in a sign that traders are skeptical the deal will pass muster. The ultimate decision still falls to the STB, but the Biden order gives the regulator ample cover to block the deal. —Sutherland is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. Read more:  There’s a Good Reason Biden Singled Out Railroads for Criticism

For a century, the Indian Council of Medical Research was a little known government body quietly studying illnesses in New Delhi. But during the pandemic, it’s taken on a role akin to Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the U.S. -- a powerful position that’s made it a controversial face of India’s struggles with Covid-19. As the ICMR has acted as a key medical adviser to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his health ministry, it’s increasingly drawn criticism from the nation’s doctors and independent scientists, who have questioned its drug recommendations and the group’s lack of transparency on data related to variants identified in India that are now spreading globally.

Long-term Treasury rates tumbled to the lowest levels in months on Monday as the spread of the delta coronavirus variant called into question optimistic assumptions about economic recovery, also touching off a global stock market slump. Market-implied expectations for a Federal Reserve rate increase were pushed further into the future amid stronger-than-normal debt-market volumes, and the rally in bonds drove benchmark 10-year yields down as much as 12 basis points to 1.17% on Monday. That’s a level unseen since early February and well below the 14-month high of 1.77% it reached in March. Some traders are now likely to begin looking toward 1%, a mark that hasn’t been breached since late January.

New York (AP) -- After a year and a half away because of the pandemic, relentless road warrior Bob Dylan returned to a concert stage on Sunday — at least online. He performed for fans who paid $25 to watch online through the live-streaming platform Veeps.

Welcome to Tuesday, Americas. Here’s the latest news and analysis from Bloomberg Economics to help you start the day:
18.07.21
When record-shattering triple-digit temperatures hit the Pacific Northwest in late June, some scientists saw more than just an extraordinarily unusual heat wave amid the severe drought and wildfires already afflicting the Western U.S. this summer. Researchers with the group World Weather Attribution studied the event, which impacted nine million people, killed hundreds, and obliterated local heat records by as many as nine degrees, and determined it could be something of a landmark in the escalation of the climate crisis — a weather event so off the charts that it would have been statistically impossible in a world before human-caused climate change. As Dutch climate researcher Geert Jan van Oldenborgh put it during an episode of The Daily, “we could be past the threshold that made these kinds of heat waves certainly much more likely.” Weather extremes once expected to come in decades are occurring today. And too many cities are dangerously unprepared.  A new joint report by McKinsey Sustainability and C40 Cities, a coalition of municipalities collaborating on environmental policies and initiatives, argues that cities need to assume what could be considered a wartime footing against the rapid escalation of the climate crisis, preparing to face and adapt to extreme weather that has already arrived. The ongoing heat emergency in the West, like the devastating flooding that swept towns in Germany and Belgium last week, represents the beginning of what these experts predict could be a continuing string of catastrophic natural disasters caused by a changing climate. In India, hundreds of millions face the possibility of lethal heat waves; in Vietnam, floodwaters engulfing Ho Chi Minh City could cost the city billions of dollars; and over time, the impacts of rising sea levels could strip tens of billions of dollars from the value of coastal real estate in Florida.  As two of the authors of Focused Adaptation: A Strategic Approach to Climate Adaptation in Cities told CityLab, they feel the dialogue around climate action has shifted, seemingly in the space of months. Instead of debating when severe climate changes will manifest, the conversation is increasingly based on the understanding that it’s too late to stop these serious impacts. Simultaneously, there’s a unique overlap of increased awareness of the dire impacts of climate change, real-time examples of its dangers, and a generally positive climate for investments and spending on resiliency that could combine to fund more widespread adaptation.  “Cities around the world are in a moment where they are making choices about investments to adapt, and are faced with a dizzying array of options on where to place money, time and intention,” said Brodie Boland, one of the report’s co-authors and a McKinsey expert on climate risk. “We wanted to provide a guide for city leaders to get a toehold on the issue and get a place to start. Instead of planning mode, we’re in immediate action mode.” The report outlines 15 strategies, chosen for being the most high-impact, easy-to-implement means of making global cities more resilient, and help local leaders work through the “multifaceted, decentralized, and unequal consequences of physical climate hazards.” Four of them are universal solutions every city should adopt: increasing awareness through research and risk assessments, incorporating climate risk through city actions and policies like zoning and urban planning, optimizing responses with early-warning systems, and enhancing financing programs like climate insurance. The remaining 11 offer contextual strategies based on climate and geography for issues like droughts or flooding. Overall, nature-based solutions, such as  planting heat-mitigating street trees or installing natural infrastructure like salt marshes as coastal barriers, are the most attractive in terms of feasibility and impact across many crises.  “Everything around you is designed with a certain environmental condition in mind,” said Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State. “And because of that, everything is at play. Every piece of infrastructure is vulnerable. But that narrative is paralyzing. If I can’t even fix the roads today, how do I fix everything?”  While the report doesn’t estimate the total potential cost of funding needed adaptation measures, a growing body of research suggests that these improvements are money well spent. The cost-benefit ratio for U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mitigation grants, for example, is 1-to-4.    “We can’t upgrade everything out there as fast as climate change is coming down upon us.” Many cities have proposed emissions reduction plans or set ambitious targets for transportations and energy shifts, but many have yet to complete exhaustive risk assessments. CDP North America, a nonprofit that assesses climate and environmental risk, tracks the climate plans of  more than 800 global cities; 93% of them recognize climate risk, but 43% don’t have adaptation plans to keep people and critical infrastructure safe, according to Katie Walsh, CDP’s head of cities, states, and regions. Local leaders told CDP that budgetary issues, housing issues and the challenge of poverty were the main deterrents to action.  And it’s often not just enough to complete a traditional risk assessment, Boland says. It’s about shifting the analysis to recognize new, faster trajectories of change, and figuring out the degree of impact those hazards will have on the current built environment. Previous guideposts like flood maps, which have been based on historical patterns, need to be more predictive. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2021 State of High Tide Flooding and Annual Outlook, released last week, found record-setting high-tide flooding last year across the entire nation, and twice as many high-tide flooding days than 20 years ago.  Currently, says Chester, the U.S. has what he calls “Band-Aided” infrastructure, which suffers from years of disinvestment and neglect. Now cities need to “make surgical investments and triage like wartime.” That requires thinking about critical infrastructure and climate forecasts and identifying systems and structures they can’t afford to let break down.  It’s also vital to recognize new or rising risks: A new report looking at “double disasters,” or extreme weather followed by an industrial accident, found a third of U.S. chemical facilities are subject to risks like flooding, storm surge and wildfire. “We can’t upgrade everything out there as fast as climate change is coming down upon us,” Chester said. The report notes the significant danger of our interconnected cities, and how flooded roads can knot up traffic and knock out public transit, or storm surges can pound coastal property and sever key power lines. “Climate change is simply moving faster than we can change infrastructure. That infrastructure will fail. We need to think about what happens when infrastructure fails. Have you designed failure into the infrastructure system itself?” Inasmuch as there’s good news in this report, it’s the fact that there’s increasing financial support for investment in adaptation. Walsh says there’s a growing appetite from the financial world for environmental impact bonds, a shift corresponding with the rise in Millennial and women investors, who demand greener options. In late June, Buffalo, New York closed on a $49 million deal to fund green stormwater infrastructure, the largest such environmental impact bond deal in U.S. history. Last week, a network of institutional investors, under the Investor Agenda network, who collectively manage tens of trillions of dollars of assets, released a letter aimed at U.S. policymakers about the infrastructure deals, arguing that “this historic effort must include visionary climate policies matching the scale and urgency of the systemic and economic risks that lie ahead” and promising to match such efforts with their own investments.  “At this moment, we have science making the imperative more clear, best-practice examples of cities doing the work, and new and innovative financial mechanisms,” said Walsh. “Now is the time to seize that.” As Congress debates different iterations of infrastructure and climate spending, either via a bill or reconciliation process, now would be an ideal time to put climate adaptation at the top of the list. McKinsey’s Boland suggests making sure dollars spent hit multiple targets, such as decarbonization, economic development and jobs, and resilience.  Activists and advocates have been pushing the U.S. government to include more adaptation measures, focused on frontline communities and those that have suffered from environmental injustice. A priority of the Sunrise Movement, a climate activism group, has been investing in cities and towns, especially the Civilian Climate Corps, a proposal to employ 1.5 million Americans to build green infrastructure modeled after WPA-era public jobs programs aimed at conservation. Other proposals, including Green New Deals for Cities and Schools, would also, in part, fund more resilient buildings. All of them, says Sunrise Movement communications director Ellen Sciales, are good policy and good politics. “We’re in a historic opportunity, coming out of a global pandemic when people are underemployed,” she said. “Voters don’t see bipartisanship, or know who Rob Portman or Joe Manchin are. They see the money invested in their communities, the jobs created, and that we’re combating the climate crisis.” Plans focused on protecting key infrastructure may overlook areas and communities that have traditionally been disinvested and discriminated against. The oft-repeated facts about how rapid urbanization in the coming decades will put more people at risk — by 2050, the report notes, more than 800 million urbanites will be impacted by sea-level rise, 1.6 billion will face chronic extreme heat, and 650 million could face water scarcity — become even more alarming when the expected ballooning of informal settlements is considered. Previous research suggested 40% of city dwellers by 2030 could live in informal settlements, and tens of million of climate refugees may be on the move by mid-century. It’s important that larger investments, and risk assessments and future plans for infrastructure protection, also factor in climate justice and frontline communities. “It’s important to ensure the investment is where the impacts are actually seen now, and prioritizing who gets the benefits,” says Snigdha Garg, senior manager of adaptation research and integration for C40 Cities and a co-author of the report. “Covid has made things more urgent, and showcased the need for that kind of prioritization.”  “It’s playing catch-up,” Garg said. “How do we get to where we need to be?”

Judith Caballero Cruz has lost two close family members to Covid-19 this year. Now she fears the pandemic could take away something else: her children’s future. For the mother of two in Mexico City, the academic year that just finished was an unrelenting struggle—as it was for families all over the world. Parents and children have had it  especially tough in Latin America, which has recorded the longest school closures of any region. By mid-June only eight countries—mostly small Caribbean islands—had managed to fully reopen their schools. March 2020 to June 2021 Data: Unesco  With schools in the Mexican capital mostly shuttered since Covid arrived, Caballero had to fight to keep her 14- and 8-year-old boys engaged in remote learning. She relied on her mobile phone package to keep them connected with online classes, until the responsibility for making funeral arrangements for her father and stepfather, and comforting  fellow mourners, ate up all her monthly data as well as her emotional energy. She tried internet cafes—but social distancing restrictions on the number of patrons meant she couldn’t accompany either child inside. At her father’s house, she tuned in to the TV channels where lessons were broadcast—but had to toggle between channels so both kids could keep up. Eventually she had to pay for two TVs and an internet connection at her own home. Together they cost about 850 pesos ($42) a month, a big chunk of the money she and her husband make selling secondhand clothes and electronics in street markets. And even that didn’t address the root of her problem. “My sons got very depressed in the pandemic when they called to tell me that my father was doing badly, that he was in a serious condition,” Caballero says. “The school environment has a big impact on them. They have a greater desire to study there, when they see other kids doing their work.” Globally, more than 800 million children have had their education disrupted by the pandemic this year, according to Unesco. In Latin America about 100 million are still affected by closures. As children fall behind, there’s a risk that economies will do the same. The World Bank estimates the interruption of schooling could translate into $1.7 trillion of lost future income in the region. Teachers often chafe at the idea that education should be measured in earnings. But Mexican educators such as Luis Martín Espino Méndez understand and share the concern underlying such statistics: that their students will drop out, with repercussions that will last the rest of their lives. Espino, who teaches history at a public school in Mexico City, finished the academic year delivering lessons from his kitchen table. At that stage of a normal year, he’d have been telling his students about Mexico’s 19th century war of independence. Instead he got only as far as the Spanish conquest some three centuries earlier. Several of his students had told him they were ditching classes to work as mechanics, salesmen, or food vendors. It’s a problem across Latin America, which had succeeded in reducing the prevalence of child labor in the years before the Covid crisis. Now that trend has likely gone into reverse: According to the International Labour Organization, the number of school-age children who are working could rise by 9 million by the end of 2022. In Mexico, authorities estimate that 1.8 million students failed to return for the 2020-21 school year because of financial hardship or pandemic-related reasons. Espino’s school lost touch with about 40% of its students and struggled to figure out how to grade them. About half were awarded a pass after doing makeup exams, and the rest still have a chance during a remedial period at the start of the next school year, part of a national plan to prevent students from failing. Espino says the process has made him worry that students could come to see their education as merely a quest to obtain a piece of paper. “We have to think about the kinds of citizens we are forming, the type of people we are forming, and what we are teaching them,” he says. “We don’t want just a generation of automatons.” Students have had to adapt to a new learning style. Some stopped attending any classes at all but continued turning in homework—the bare minimum needed to pass—through WhatsApp or Facebook, or by hand-delivering their notebooks. While the national plan focused on televised classes, teachers in areas with internet access offered classes via videoconferencing platforms so they could interact with students. Fifteen-year-old Eduardo Mondragón Salgado, who wants to study aeronautics, says he’s barely left the house since Covid struck, because he’s asthmatic. He stopped joining his friends for soccer games and spends most of his days at a makeshift desk squeezed in at the foot of a bed. “There used to be moments when I got stressed about just being at home, and I used to go hang out with my friends, and that would make me calmer,” he says. Many teachers in Mexico City voted not to return to school in June, when authorities said public-health conditions had improved enough to make it feasible. They pointed out that some of their schools lack running water and only they, not their students, were vaccinated. Other states resumed classes only to suspend them again when case counts started to go back up. While studies have suggested that schools aren’t major sites of contagion, it’s hard for countries in Latin America to make classrooms safe. For starters, they’re overcrowded: An Inter-American Development Bank study found that class sizes across the region would have to be cut as much as 40% to achieve proper social distancing. And the pace of vaccine rollouts locally is lagging that in wealthier countries. It all added up to a risk that teachers didn’t want to take—even though they acknowledge the inadequacy of the online and televised substitutes. “All we can do is put Band-Aids on the problem and provide basic learning conditions,” says Sulem Estrada Saldaña, who teaches Spanish in Mexico City but made the decision not to return to in-person teaching when she was consulted by her school’s administrators in May. “We know the kids need far more than that.” Teachers say extra resources might be needed next academic year. Last month the government announced that the 2021-22 school year will be 10 days longer than usual, at 200 days, to try to make up for the material not covered last year. According to a national teachers’ union, Covid-19 has claimed the lives of at least 2,000 educators, which will make catching up more difficult. Parents have had to wrestle with the same dilemma that confronts teachers and school authorities: balancing the future costs of interrupted learning against health risks today. Caballero says she’d been coming round to the idea of sending her kids back to school for a few days a week, but other parents and teachers voted against it. Rosa María Salgado Cabrera, Eduardo’s mom, wants him back in school only when he’s vaccinated.  Mexico’s president says the whole adult population will have at least one shot by October, but there’s no timeline yet for teens and younger children. Salgado, who runs a breakfast stand in front of their home, has already seen one of her sons quit school, at age 16, when the family was saddled with unexpected medical bills because of her husband’s diabetes. She’s been shocked by the costs of remote learning, from textbook fees to lab supplies, that have forced other students to drop out. But she’s determined that won’t happen to her younger son. As for Eduardo, he insists he’s gearing up to return next semester, starting in August. “I just want to keep going, in school and in life,” he says. —With Maria Eloisa Capurro

As the European Union gets serious about fighting climate change, experts are fielding more calls than ever from polluters seeking help to trap, process and store their carbon emissions. The business of capturing emissions from industrial plants that make everything from cement to energy will get a push from the European Commission’s  ambitious climate plan and a continued rally in carbon permits, as widely forecast by analysts, traders and utilities. While the industry isn’t profitable yet, operators expect it will be soon.

Even before Covid-19 struck, Brazil’s census was in trouble. In 2019, the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro announced that the number of survey questions in the decennial population count, set for 2020, would be reduced due to budgetary restraints. Amid the first wave of Covid-19 outbreaks in March 2020, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said that the census would be postponed to 2021. In April, the Brazilian government canceled it, due to heavy national spending cuts due to the country’s decade-long economic crisis exacerbated by the pandemic.  Now the census is set to proceed in 2022, after a state government sued and the Supreme Court ruled in May that the government would need to find the funds necessary to carry it out.  The story is similar in other Latin American countries. Government leaders have also postponed or canceled census activities in Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile in recent months, citing the ravaging effects of Covid-19. Echoing experts in the U.S., who fear that the 2020 enumeration effort could be marred by data gaps and the effects of political manipulation from the Trump administration, demographers and other researchers are warning that the social effects of a lack of accurate population data could be felt by citizens for years to come. Besides counting residents, national censuses brings data on living conditions, employment, income, access to sanitation, and schooling, and help inform social policies that distribute federal resources. Without new census data, for example, funding levels for Brazil’s municipalities will freeze at 2010 levels, said Roberto do Carmo, professor of the Department of Demography at the University of Campinas and president of the Brazilian Association of Population Studies. That could leave areas that have grown poorer or more populous with fewer resources than they need, and create challenges for vulnerable citizens in accessing social benefits and programs. Outdated census data has already created problems for the Bolsonaro administration when it distributed pandemic emergency aid to low-income people in 2020. “There was no detailed and reliable information that could indicate the extent of the aid that would be needed,” Carmo said.  The disruptions created by the pandemic — which has cost the lives of more than 534,000 people in Brazil and sent unemployment and inequality skyrocketing — are real. Countries all over the world, including the U.S., China and India, were also forced by Covid-19 to push back scheduled population surveys and data releases. Brazil’s census workers would have required costly precautions, such as personal protective equipment, and the results would likely have been complicated by a low response rate among wary residents. But Carmo said that the political ideology animating the Bolsonaro administration jibes with the delays and attempted cancelation.   “This government defines itself as contrary to knowledge,” he said, pointing to Bolsonaro’s repeated characterization of Covid as a “little flu,” refusal to wear masks at public events, and denial of climate change while promoting massive deforestation in the Amazon. “The census provides knowledge about the country’s social and demographic context that is accurate, qualified and detailed. So, in a way, the census opposes the basic principles advocated by the current government.” (The Bolsonaro administration did not respond to requests for comment.) This is not the first time that the Brazilian census has been postponed: The 1990 census was conducted a year late, due to an economic crisis and political instability that ultimately led to the 1992 impeachment of then-President Fernando Collor de Mello. “With the exception of Mexico, census postponements have always existed in Latin American countries for different reasons, ranging from economic crises, budgetary reasons and/or lack of prioritization and alignment with political calendars,” said Fabiana Del Popolo, who leads demography and population research at the Latin American and Caribbean Demographic Center. In Ecuador, for example, an April resolution by the nation’s Emergency Operations Committee requested that the 10-year census be postponed until 2022 to protect census agents from infection as the country faces a deep health and economic crisis as a result of both Covid and years of  austerity measures. Prior to the pandemic, the national government had already stripped the budget of its census bureau and removed its autonomy, causing delays in its ability to prepare, make technical decisions, and damaging its legitimacy, said Byron Villacis, the former general director of the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses of Ecuador and a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley. “The census problem started before the pandemic,” said Villacis. “Then, with the arrival of the pandemic, the problem worsened but was used as an excuse to justify delays and interventions.” In April, Bolivia postponed the census planned for 2022 to no sooner than 2024. Fabián Yaksic, former director of the Departmental Autonomy Service of La Paz  and now an independent consultant, said that while the health emergency is the major factor in Bolivia’s move, there’s a potential political dimension to the decision: A new census could reveal population growth in areas that generally oppose the current socialist-led government, such as the heavily urbanized region of Santa Cruz. In April, the governor-elect of the Santa Cruz region, Luis Fernando Camacho, declared to the local press that postponing the Census was a “de facto confiscation of resources that correspond to the regions.” “Any delay in knowing population data implies that municipal governments must support public investment and municipal services to a larger population with the same resources as 10 years ago or more,” Yaksic said. Another country that also delayed its 2020 census was Chile. According to Del Popolo, the country was well advanced in its planning and the reasons for the delay were in fact due to the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. Chile has one of the world’s highest vaccination rates, with more than 70% of the population having received one dose, but infections have spiked once again in the past month. But in other countries, the census slowdown may signal something more troubling — an accelerating loss of once-public knowledge, Villacis said. In the case of Brazil, the data delay means that the cascade of miseries unleashed by the pandemic, including data on rising poverty and the return of widespread hunger, could remain partially hidden from lawmakers and citizens alike. Private institutes might compile some of that data, but not all of it, he said. “If you attack the statistical offices, serious social problems will no longer be measured.”

Potent methane plumes have been detected in a key coal mining district in Australia, one of the world’s biggest exporters of the commodity, underscoring the fossil fuel’s role in exacerbating climate change. Clouds of the invisible greenhouse gas, which is over 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at warming the Earth in its first couple decades in the atmosphere, were spotted near multiple mines last month, an analysis of European Space Agency satellite data by geoanalytics firm Kayrros SAS showed.

SAP SE said that its business-travel unit started to see signs of recovery, and the company slightly raised its estimates for full-year cloud sales and profit after its push to get more enterprise customers on its Rise program picked up pace. The company’s Concur business, which helps users book business travel and suffered during pandemic restrictions, saw “the first signs of recovery” and stabilizing performance in the quarter, Walldorf, Germany-based SAP said in a statement on Wednesday. Still, the business is unlikely to recover to its pre-pandemic levels this year, Chief Executive Officer Christian Klein said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.

Senate Republicans are set to thwart Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s bid to start Senate debate Wednesday on a still-unfinished infrastructure plan, but key GOP lawmakers said that the deal is not dead and that they will be ready to move ahead next week. Schumer’s decision to force an early test vote Wednesday afternoon spurred a faster pace in protracted talks for a $579 billion infrastructure plan, but not the completed deal that GOP senators are demanding as a prerequisite to begin debate.

It might seem contradictory to invest in carbon-emitting polluters while pledging to be an eco-trailblazer, but that’s exactly what Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Pte is attempting to do. As one of the world’s largest institutional investors, its $282 billion portfolio is replete with businesses that contribute to global warming -- from Singapore Airlines Ltd. to Sembcorp Marine Ltd., a supplier of offshore rigs. While peers like Norway’s sovereign wealth fund have used hard targets and the sale of assets to improve their green credentials, Temasek is taking a different path.

Joe and I have  pointed out before that on a longer-term chart the move lower in U.S. Treasury yields doesn’t look so odd. In fact, it’s the sharp upwards move that starts to look weird. As Joe  mentioned before, the move upwards that took place between the  U.S. presidential election in November and early in the Spring coincided with a Democratic sweep of Georgia and the flipping of the Senate into Democratic control. That set off a ton of speculation that Democrats would push through a fiscal-heavy agenda — all while the Federal Reserve kept policy relatively easy, which contributed to expectations for higher growth and more inflation and therefore higher yields at the long-end.The Bear Traps report points out that higher yields as politicians coalesce around an agenda isn’t necessarily a new dynamic. In fact they say the yield curve has a history of steepening as control of the U.S. government shifts from two parties to one party. That’s exactly what happened in late 2016, when President Donald Trump won the presidency with Republicans in control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.You can see the dynamic from the (rough) chart below, which shows bond yields moving up when there’s a big spike in Republican or Democrat confidence, according to the Michigan survey of consumers (which I’ve used as a proxy for the parties securing greater control). Of course, the opposite move can also happen when a party loses control — with bond yields heading lower after the GOP lost control of Congress in late 2018.

Hiram Lodge, the manipulative crime lord who targets the fictional town of Riverdale, sits back in his office chair. After plotting his latest scheme with a cohort over submarine sandwiches, he takes a bite of a Doritos chip, holding the bag in clear view of the camera while looking away pensively. Frito-Lay, which got the snack on the CW Network’s teen drama Riverdale with the help of the No. 1 product placement company BEN, hopes audiences noticed enough to crave their own bag of Doritos, but not so much that they became annoyed. That’s the delicate balance companies strike when using product placement, which is becoming an even more popular form of advertising thanks to factors including increasingly sophisticated data collection and the rise of streaming and mobile video. Linear television, the old-school version of programming in which viewers have to be on their sofas at a scheduled time, is becoming an activity of the past, reducing promotional opportunities for brands. Meanwhile, more people are tuning in to Netflix or other streaming services that eschew conventional ads. “If I’m starting to cobble together my viewing experience as a series of streaming services, I potentially don’t get exposed to traditional television advertising anymore,” says David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University. “So product placement becomes the way of cutting down the cost associated with production when you don’t have advertising to support you.” To do that, product placement is morphing into a more tech-focused and targeted business that can mesh nicely with the data-driven strategies that have proved so successful for digital marketing companies such as  Facebook Inc. and  Google. While advertisers still try to weave their products into the fabric of a film or TV show’s plot, a lot more is happening behind the scenes to guarantee those marketing dollars will turn into a sale. For one, entertainment consumers are naturally separating themselves into smaller, like-minded groups. Twentieth century viewers tuned in en masse to a few evening network TV programs, meaning ad placements were largely a game of reaching an enormous number of people while hoping to resonate with a few. But 21st century viewers often let a Netflix or TikTok algorithm suggest what to watch next, meaning advertising opportunities can be smaller-scale but reach a more-tailored audience. 2020 movies by product placement value Data: Concave Brand Tracking Product placement value determined by number of viewers, time onscreen, and prominence Advancing technology also helps. BEN has developed, through artificial intelligence and machine learning, the ability to fairly accurately determine which new TV shows will become hits. The team communicates that to Frito-Lay and other companies looking to gain visibility for their brands or products via Hollywood. The company, owned by Microsoft Inc. founder Bill Gates, also plans to partner with data company 605, which captures information from set-top boxes and smart TVs. With that information in hand, a company like BEN has new digitally enabled flexibility. People watching the exact same scene of the same show may be advertised different products, depending on who and where they are. Hiram Lodge was eating a bag of Doritos, but it’s possible to digitally swap that bag with Ruffles, if that brand better caters to the personal taste of the viewer. “If you’re able to navigate the content, and you have the technology to be able to figure out to prioritize and predict how to best target your audience, you can literally have the impact of a Super Bowl ad every week,” says Ricky Ray Butler, the chief executive officer of BEN. “There’s seriously that much content that is out there.” Product placement could benefit from another challenge in the advertising world: consumer pushback against hypertargeted online ads. Just as viewers are increasingly intolerant of having a TV show interrupted for ad breaks—and willing to pay for ad-free versions of streaming services—they’re also growing weary of feeling dogged for weeks by digital ads associated with things they search for on platforms like Google and Facebook.  Apple Inc. has started to  limit such hyperfocused advertising, and others may follow suit, offering product placement yet another opportunity to break ground. “Consumers are getting wise to it, and that’s why, I think, Apple was the first one” to crack down, says Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing company Metaforce. “Product placement can be more natural, and part of what marketers are searching for is authenticity.” Global product placement spending is projected to rise 13.8%, to $23.3 billion, in 2021 from a year earlier. During the same period, overall marketing spending is expected to rise only 5.9%, to $1.35 trillion, according to data from researcher PQ Media. The more the technique is used, the more marketers are able to determine whether the messaging worked. In a 2019 study, Schweidel and Indiana University professor Beth Fossen found they could track product placement in TV shows with an uptick in social media chatter and web traffic to the companies. BEN studies what consumer opinions of brands are after they’ve been exposed to product placement, but is trying to sift through huge amounts of data to get more precise readings. BEN is also working to measure how the practice stimulates retail foot traffic and ultimately in-store purchases. “So long as we continue to see positive returns from paid product placement, and consumer behavior continues to pivot toward media consumption in ad-free/ad-light environments, I would anticipate more investment will follow,” James Clarke, a senior director of media strategy at Frito-Lay North America, said in an email. Still, more data-driven hypertargeting of product placement could stoke the same kind of consumer pushback that online digital ads have received. CEO Butler is aware the practice could cause some discomfort, especially when it’s bankrolled by Gates, one of the 10 richest people on Earth. But he says that the complex data his company uses to help marketers is all about explaining how groups—rather than individuals—react, while conceding that his focus is on ensuring his company’s product placements turn into sales. “It’s the next frontier of advertising,” Butler says. “Because of all this data, you can get way more impact and guarantees that people are actually seeing the content you’re in.”

Welcome to Thursday, Asia. Here’s the latest news and analysis from Bloomberg Economics to help you start the day:
20.07.21
Senate Republicans blocked debate on a vast and still-unfinished infrastructure plan, rejecting Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s drive to forge ahead while negotiators from both parties struggle to complete details of the $579 billion package. The 49-51 vote fell well shy of the 60 needed to begin debate. Schumer switched his vote to “no” so he can call up the bill again.
20.07.21
Verizon Communications Inc. exceeded wireless-subscriber growth estimates for the second quarter, with promotions for new phones helping the carrier in the race to sign up customers for new, faster 5G services. Verizon signed up 528,000 regular monthly subscribers in the quarter, the New York-based company said in a statement Wednesday, beating the 360,400 average analyst estimate. Profit rose to $1.37 a share, excluding some items, topping the $1.30 that analysts had expected on average, and the company raised its full-year earnings guidance.
20.07.21
Texas Instruments Inc. gave a revenue forecast for the current period that disappointed some investors, raising concerns that a jump in chip demand caused by the pandemic will be short-lived. The stock fell in early U.S. trading.Sales will be $4.4 billion to $4.76 billion in the period ending in September, Texas Instruments said Wednesday in a statement. Profit will be $1.87 to $2.13 a share, the company said. On average, analysts predicted profit of $1.97 a share and sales of $4.59 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Like other chipmakers, Texas Instruments has posted multiple quarters of double-digit percentage revenue growth, boosted by demand for a wide variety of devices that contain its tiny electronic components. The rapid run-up has caused speculation among analysts and investors that some of the orders reflect panic buying by customers who have grown anxious they won’t be able get enough supply. Such behavior in the past has caused crashes.
20.07.21
Harley-Davidson Inc. tumbled the most in more than five months after warnings of supply-chain bottlenecks and tight motorcycle inventory overshadowed better-than-expected second-quarter profit. Cost cuts and a post-pandemic sales rebound in the U.S. helped Harley beat Wall Street estimates. But Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz warned that chip shortages and shipping delays are hampering efforts to replenish motorcycle inventories after last year’s pandemic shutdowns.

South African government, business and labor leaders are discussing the payment of a relief grant to alleviate suffering after the worst unrest since the end of apartheid. While labor and business leaders recognize the need for some assistance after the riots, there is a debate over whether the stipend should be temporary or the start of a form of a basic income grant. The violence that began after the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma left at least 234 people dead, devastated businesses and put jobs at risk.

The largest U.S. technology companies continued to spend millions on lobbying last quarter, seeking to sway legislation intended to bolster antitrust enforcement and force other changes on the industry. Apple Inc. increased its spending to $1.64 million in the second quarter, up 12.3% from the previous quarter. Amazon Inc.’s total increased by 1.3% to $4.86 million. Lobbying expenditures by Microsoft Corp. dipped slightly, down 4.6% to $2.47 million and Facebook Inc. mostly held steady at $4.77 million. Alphabet Inc.’s Google spent $2.09 million, down 22.3% from last quarter, but up 23.7% from last year.

A wall hoarding about 20-meters tall with an advertisement by South Africa’s oldest burial house, Avbob, looms over people entering downtown Johannesburg. “Standing strong for our people. We are here for you. Since 1918,” it reads. In the city center, which was among sites hit by last week’s unrest, there are signs for funeral-cover packages everywhere in the midst of hawkers selling chicken kebabs, corn on the cob, electronics, fresh fruit, clothes and wigs. In a store front, employees of insurance company Two Mountains said its agents across the city have been handing out flyers with plans that include a “prince dome cherry casket.” Across the street, a grocery shop has a sign in the doorway offering funeral insurance for as little as 2 rand ($0.14) a day.  Airwaves are flooded with burial-cover ads and supermarket chains like Shoprite are bombarding clients with offers of funeral help to shop with them.

Lumber futures rose, posting the biggest percentage gain in more than a year on concern that wildfires in western Canada will reduce supply and spur more curtailments at sawmills. British Columbia, Canada’s biggest exporter of lumber to the U.S., declared a state of emergency, and Canfor Corp. said it would trim output as the fires snarl transportation and supply chains. Lumber jumped 7.7% in Chicago, the largest advance for a most-active contract since April 2020. The price is still more than 60% below the record-high reached in May.

Traders dealing in vegetable oil are scurrying to get a read on expectations that the world’s biggest supplier of soybean oil could ramp up exports by almost 10%. Argentina’s biofuels industry anticipates an additional 500,000 metric tons of soy oil being freed up for export after the South American nation approved a new law last week that cut the blend mandate in diesel fuel in half. That could impact the global market and Argentina, which shipped 5.36 million tons of the soybean extract last year:

Los Angeles (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday to four counts of rape and seven other sexual assault counts. Sheriff’s deputies brought the 69-year-old convicted rapist into court in a wheelchair. He was wearing a brown jail jumpsuit and face mask. Attorney Mark Werksman entered the plea for the disgraced movie mogul a day after Weinstein was extradited to California from New York, where he was serving a 23-year prison term.

A widening conflict in northern Ethiopia displaced tens of thousands of people, after fighting spread from the Tigray region to neighboring Afar state, a government official said. The violence forced 54,000 people to flee their homes in Afar, adding to the more than 2 million who’ve been displaced since war erupted in Tigray in November. The unrest has curbed output in what was once Africa’s fastest-growing economy and contributed to the Ethiopian government’s announcement in January that it plans to seek debt relief from creditors.
20.07.21
Paris (AP) -- Visitors now need a special COVID-19 pass to ride up the Eiffel Tower or visit French museums or movie theaters, the first step in a new campaign against what the government calls a “stratospheric” rise in delta variant infections. As the new rule came into effect Wednesday, tourists who came to the Paris landmark unprepared lined up for quick virus tests at the site. To get the pandemic pass, people must show they are either fully vaccinated, have tested negative for the coronavirus or recovered from COVID-19.

Japan is set to make dramatic changes to how it generates electricity by the end of the decade, slashing its dependence on fossil fuels and upping its reliance on renewable energy in an ambitious effort to reduce emissions. Renewable energy, which includes solar, wind and hydropower, should make up more than a third of the nation’s power generation by the fiscal year starting April 2030, according to a draft report released Wednesday. That’s up from its previous target of less than a quarter. Hydrogen was also added to the mix for the first time.
20.07.21
Daimler AG said early-year growth for its main Mercedes-Benz division will be erased by the global semiconductor shortage that the luxury-car maker expects to put a damper on the second half. Mercedes car sales are now expected to be roughly flat this year rather than up significantly from 2020. The lack of chips will have an adverse impact on the business as the year progresses and visibility on how supply will develop is low, Daimler said Wednesday.

When  Moira Gilchrist was first approached by Philip Morris International Inc., she wondered what a tobacco company wanted from a scientist who had previously worked on clinical trials for anti-cancer drugs. The world’s largest cigarette maker was looking at ways of delivering nicotine in a product that reduced the harmful chemicals in smoking, and needed her expertise in navigating the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry. Gilchrist, a cigarette smoker at the time, made the leap in 2006 — to the shock of friends and colleagues — becoming one of the first people from the pharma sector to join Big Tobacco, viewed by many as the enemy of health.
20.07.21
Las Vegas Sands Corp., the big casino operator, fell in late trading after reporting second-quarter results that trailed Wall Street estimates, hurt by continued travel restrictions in Macau and Singapore. Adjusted property earnings came to $244 million, the company said Wednesday, short of the $290.6 million average of estimates compiled by Consensus Metrix. The adjusted loss per share totaled 26 cents, larger than the 17 cents analysts forecast.
20.07.21
Saudi Aramco confirmed that some company files were leaked after hackers reportedly demanded a $50 million ransom from the world’s most-valuable oil producer. “Aramco recently became aware of the indirect release of a limited amount of company data which was held by third-party contractors,” the Middle Eastern oil major said Wednesday in an email. “We confirm that the release of data was not due to a breach of our systems, has no impact on our operations, and the company continues to maintain a robust cybersecurity posture.”

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will have to manage two separate sets of delicate negotiations this fall around a global corporate-tax accord, each with clashing deadlines that could threaten the ultimate success of the deal. Group of 20 nations plan to finalize the details of a landmark global minimum tax and a rewrite of international tax rules at a summit in late October. That’s also right when congressional Democrats hope to be nearing passage of a $3.5 trillion bill that’s the party’s one shot to make much of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda a reality. Any change in the parameters in one negotiation risks jeopardizing the other deal.
20.07.21
Buenos Aires’s creditors are divided over a $7.1 billion debt restructuring proposal, signaling that Argentina’s largest province still has work to do to emerge from default. The province’s economy ministry issued a statement early Wednesday that it agreed with its biggest investor, GoldenTree Asset Management, and certain other creditors on terms and conditions. Other bondholders issued their own statement in the late afternoon, saying they weren’t part of the accord. That called into question how close the province is to successfully restructuring its debt.

Washington (AP) -- Lagging vaccination rates among nursing home staff are being linked to a national increase in COVID-19 infections and deaths at senior facilities, and are at the center of a federal investigation in a hard-hit Colorado location where disease detectives found many workers were not inoculated. The investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of facilities in the Grand Junction, Colorado, area raises concerns among public health doctors that successes in protecting vulnerable elders with vaccines could be in peril as the more aggressive delta variant spreads across the country.

More than 2 billion tons of food goes uneaten around the world, almost double than previously thought, according to a new report. An estimated 2.5 billion tons of food was lost on farms or wasted by retailers or consumers globally, accounting for about 40% of production, according to research by World Wildlife Fund and U.K. retailer Tesco Plc. The figure tops the previous estimates by about 1.2 billion tons, with farming in wealthier countries being a bigger offender than assumed, they said in a report.

Inflation took a toll on the U.K. public finances last month, driving interest payments on government debt to unprecedented levels. The Treasury paid 8.7 billion pounds ($11.8 billion) in interest in June, the most for any month since records began in 1997, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. The 6 billion-pound increase from a year ago was due to higher retail-price inflation pushing up the cost of servicing index-linked gilts.

Disgraced diamond tycoon Nirav Modi’s extradition to India would severely impact his mental health and be a “flagrant denial of justice,” his lawyers said at a London court hearing. Modi is accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of $2 billion over seven years. The one-time billionaire applied to the U.K. High Court to appeal his extradition on the basis he wouldn’t receive a fair trial in India.

The 147 Republicans who voted against certifying President Joe Biden’s victory are still feeling the sting of decreased support from corporations, a review of second quarter Federal Election Commission filings shows. Those Republicans saw a 31% decline in contributions from other committees, including corporate political action committees, in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2019, the most recent non-election year. But lobbying groups and companies that depend on government spending revived or maintained their support of lawmakers regardless of any position the recipients had on the 2020 election. The top donors to the House members who refused to finalize the election for Biden after supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol were the American Crystal Sugar Company PAC, which gave $160,000,; the General Dynamics Corp. PAC, which donated $88,500, the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers PAC, which gave $87,500 and the National Association of Realtors PAC, which gave $86,500. Dozens of businesses and trade associations announced they would pause giving or review of their contribution policies in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot. But many groups have quietly resumed giving, including to the election objectors. Others made no changes to their policies and continued to donate to members who aligned with their interests. The top 10 largest donors included three defense contractors whose business is based on government contracts. Lockheed Martin Corp. announced a suspension in giving but resumed in April. General Dynamics never said it would stop its donations. L3Harris Technologies Inc. declined to comment on its PAC’s policies. FEC records show it began giving on March 18. Top business PAC donors to Republicans who opposed election result Source: Federal Election Commission filings Note: Through June 30, 2021 Financed by voluntary donations from company employees, corporate PACs generally give to both Republicans and Democrats when it benefits the company’s regulatory agenda. General Dynamics said in its most recent corporate sustainability report that it “participates in the U.S. political process when it is in the best interests of shareholders, businesses and employees to do so.” Ken Calvert Photographer: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call Group/Getty Images The defense giant tied for second with $85,500 in PAC contributions. Lockheed Martin gave $77,500 and L3Harris Technologies gave $70,000. Representative Ken Calvert of California, the top Republican on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, received contributions from all three, totaling $22,000, the most received by any of the objectors. “Our PAC program will continue to observe the long-standing principles of non-partisan political engagement in support of our business interests,” Lockheed Martin said in a statement. A spokesman for General Dynamics declined to comment, and L3Harris Technologies did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier: Toyota Revives Donations Ban to Republicans Who Opposed Election Unlike lobbying groups and defense contractors, so-called consumer-facing companies have to weigh potential public reaction with their political interests when making donations. Social media users unleashed harsh criticism of Toyota Motor Corp. after it resumed contributions. The company said it wouldn’t judge members of Congress “solely based on their votes on the electoral certification” and its PAC donated $85,500 to Republicans who voted against ratifying Biden’s win, ranking them fifth. The automaker’s donations, first reported by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, led to the hashtag, #ToyotaHatesDemocracy. On July 8, the company announced that it would no longer donate to Republicans who objected to Biden’s win. The PAC for the American Crystal Sugar Company, an agricultural cooperative whose members include beet sugar producers in the Midwest, doled out $160,000 to 31 of the objecting members, including maximum $10,000 contributions to Representatives Kat Cammack of Florida, Michael Cloud of Texas and Tracey Mann of Kansas, all members of the House Agriculture Committee. Federal programs that benefit American sugar producers include federal loans, import quotas and other mechanisms that support the price of the commodity, according to the Congressional Research Service. American Crystal, which said in January it would not base its contribution decisions on the certification vote, did not respond to a request for comment.

It tied with General Dynamics, donating $85,500 to 53 of them. The realtors’ PAC, one of the biggest donors, also gave to Democrats and other Republicans.“This decision will ensure we continue to engage with political candidates to support America’s homeowners and our nation’s real estate industry,” the National Association of Realtors said in a statement.

(AP) -- Julia Ducournau's “Titane,” a wild body-horror thriller featuring sex with a car and a surprisingly tender heart, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making Ducournau just the second female filmmaker to win the festival’s top honor in its 74 year history. The win on Saturday was mistakenly announced by jury president Spike Lee at the top of the closing ceremony, broadcast in France on Canal+, unleashing a few moments of confusion. Ducournau, a French filmmaker, didn't come to the stage to accept the award until the formal announcement at the end of the ceremony. But the early hint didn't diminish from her emotional response.

Shares in Japanese homebuilder Tama Home Co. plunged in Tokyo on Wednesday after reports the firm’s president told employees they’d be punished if they got coronavirus vaccines. Weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun, citing several unidentified workers, reported that President Shinya Tamaki told managers that he opposed coronavirus vaccines. The report said Tamaki warned that people who received the vaccine would die in five years, while internal e-mails told employees of the reported dangers of 5G phones.

Just 17 years after Liverpool was listed as a World Heritage site by Unesco, the United Nations organization has stripped the U.K. city of its status.  Major redevelopment along Maritime Mercantile City, a waterfront collection of quays, warehouses and grand shipping institutions built during Liverpool’s heyday as a global port in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, has proved “detrimental to the site’s authenticity and integrity,” Unesco says. Now no longer possessing the coherence for which it was recognized in 2004, the Maritime Mercantile City has joined Dresden’s Elbe Valley  and Oman’s Arabian Oryx Sanctuary to become one of just three World Heritage sites ever to be deleted from the Unesco list. The move, announced this week after a secret ballot during a Unesco meeting in Fuzhou, China, did not exactly come as a surprise: The group placed Liverpool on its World Heritage in Danger list in 2012, while public concerns about the waterfront’s preservation date back at least as far  as 2009, when a new ferry terminal won Britain’s Carbuncle Cup for ugliest new building. At the heart of Unesco’s concerns is a 5 billion pound ($6.8 billion) waterfront redevelopment project known as “Liverpool Waters.” Piloted by the Peel Group — once referred to by Britain’s Independent newspaper as “the biggest company you’ve never heard of” — the project promised to transform the waterfront into a U.K. version of Shanghai’s Pudong, where gleaming new skyscrapers overlook a historic core. This prospect proved alarming to many critics of the project in Liverpool as well, who fear the planned towers would sit poorly with the rest of the area. England’s national historic preservation body, English Heritage, said that the development would “overwhelm the historic, horizontal character of the docklands” and suggested that the national government should consider overruling the city’s planning approval. Others fret that the development reflects now-outdated pre-pandemic assumptions about the lack of prime office space in the city. Further concerns were raised by the approval of a new waterfront stadium for Everton Football Club. Local reaction to the Unesco delisting so far has largely been defiant. Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, commented that, with their overzealous attitude, Unesco’s “risk rendering themselves irrelevant,” and that while Liverpool did not want to lose its listing, the city could not “allow that status to preserve our region in aspic, while the world evolves around us.” The city’s Chamber of Commerce said that the listing could not be maintained “at the expense of developing our city for the benefit of future generations,” while the city council tweeted that Liverpool was “not defined by labels.” Others note that Unesco seems to show little concern for Liverpool’s economic health, and is objecting to buildings that will be constructed on what is currently derelict land. In a blog post, City of Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson pointed out that 700 million pounds has been plowed into historical preservation projects over the past decade, and, despite repeated invitations and significant changes to the plans for Liverpool Waters, a full Unesco mission has not visited the site since 2011. “It’s clear now” she wrote, “that UNESCO didn’t want to see. Or listen. Or engage.” There is still no avoiding the fact that the de-listing is a blow for the city, and for the U.K. itself. And for observers beyond Liverpool, the decision opens a wider debate on whether new development, good or bad, is a genuine threat to heritage. The Liverpool waterfront itself, after all, is not a unified architectural set piece, but the accretion of generations of growth. It houses structures intended to be grand and opulent — notably the so-called Three Graces, a trio of monumental early 20th century stone buildings that give the waterfront its unmistakeable skyline — and many others intended to be strictly utilitarian — warehouses that have since been restored and repurposed as art galleries, studios, homes and offices. The district also has wastelands of parking lot and indifferent contemporary buildings erected before 2004 here and there. While it has beauty and charisma, few would argue that it’s akin to Venice. (Though, in The Spectator, design critic Stephen Bayley does.) But it has never tried to be. Looking back over Unesco’s track record, the organization does seem to struggle with the dynamics of urban settings. On its list of 14 primary threats to heritage sites, menaces like environmental degradation and pollution appear alongside encroachment from newer structures and skyline changes from residential or commercial development — all very likely to occur in an economically vibrant city. Cities often agree to follow height restrictions as part of the terms of accepting World Heritage status. In 2017, Vienna was placed on Unesco’s endangered list, for example, after plans emerged for a tall-ish tower that would have interfered with views of city’s historic center.  It still seems significant that the only other European World Heritage site to have been de-listed was also in a major city undergoing redevelopment — Dresden’s Elbe Valley. This was removed from the list in 2009 due to the addition of a (beautiful) road bridge over the river’s flood meadows, even though the area’s character was, like Liverpool’s waterfront, the product of several centuries celebrated partly for works of industrial-era engineering. It is perhaps understandable that Unesco felt that Liverpool’s development aspirations were working against its preservation obligations. For cities seeking to both spur economic growth and protect their existing World Heritage status, the decision will likely be met with some ambivalence.

A Singapore court on Wednesday ruled in favor of liquidating Hyflux Ltd., following a years-long saga in one of the city-state’s most high-profile distressed cases. The ruling came in a hearing that was adjourned from July 12 after Utico FZC, one of Hyflux’s suitors, asked to be heard on its application to intervene in the case. Hyflux said last month the judicial manager terminated discussions with United Arab Emirates-based Utico as it was unable to meet the conditions required.

Perhaps, in retrospect, it was foolish to ever think of the world in black-and-white terms during the age of Covid-19. Yet that’s the trap so many of us fell into, whether corner-suite executives planning a workforce’s return, decision makers in government, or investors trying to get in front of wherever the markets decide to go next. The scintillating vision of the dark era of Covid lockdowns quickly giving way to a  bright, vaccinated future was simply too enticing to resist. But, at the moment, a much-less-satisfying reality is settling in: a sort of  gray area between full recovery and the lockdown-era doldrums as the virus stages a fresh assault on the unvaccinated, and its relentless mutations raise questions even for those who’ve gotten their shots. Consider the mixed messages in the past week as the midway point approaches for a summer heralded as the start of a new roaring ‘20s, at least in the U.S. and much of Europe. Britain celebrated the easing of Covid restrictions on July 19 in what was branded “Freedom Day.” Yet its prime minister was  locked up in quarantine, and U.S. officials issued a stern warning for Americans to  stay away from the U.K. because the virus was raging there again. Los Angeles  reinstated indoor mask mandates, while New York  declined to do the same. As “back to school” signs began popping up at stores,  Apple Inc. pushed back its deadline for employees to  return to the office. In Tokyo, the buzz is about which Olympic athletes have  caught the virus instead of which ones will wear the most medals. For those who trust the alleged wisdom of crowds in the financial markets, the picture is foggy. Benchmark indexes took a dip in the middle of July, though they got a partial rebound with a  strong rally on July 20. Even before that, share prices had been slumping for companies expected to reap the biggest windfalls from a post-Covid boom—and not just for the likes of airlines, cruise lines, and hotel companies, but also for banks, energy producers, and wide swaths of the small-cap market. Unprofitable companies—stocks that are popular when the appetite for speculative, risky investments is strong—have been among the worst hit. “Obviously the bond markets are suggesting to us that there’s some weakness in growth” The prognosis from the bond market arguably has been even more worrying for equity investors seeking a second opinion. Early in the year, as optimism spread that vaccines would unleash bottled-up consumer savings and demand to create a prolonged expansion, investors sold off the safest of assets such as Treasuries, pushing the yield on the 10-year note up to 1.74% by the end of March. Yet they’ve been returning to that haven ever since, bidding bond prices back up and dragging the yield back down closer to 1%. In general, booming bond markets are a  sign of pessimism. “Obviously the bond markets are suggesting to us that there’s some weakness in growth, and that is linked to the delta variant” of the coronavirus, Katie Koch, co-head of fundamental equities at  Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV on July 20. Yet to her and many of her peers, the signals being sent by corporate America are more positive and stronger than the bond market’s. As second-quarter earnings start trickling in—with about one-tenth of the companies in the S&P 500 reporting results so far—the early read is encouraging: More than 86% of the companies that have reported have beaten analyst estimates, and profit growth is clocking in at a breathtaking 141%, according to Bloomberg data. Still, that growth compares to the second quarter of 2020, when Covid’s grip on the economy was  tightest. But to Koch and many of her peers, just because the results will probably mark the recovery’s peak, there’s no reason to give up on equities now. Although the growth that’s to follow will be less dazzling, it’s still significant. S&P 500 companies are forecast to boost profits by more than 10% in both 2022 and 2023, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Digging deeper into the signals being sent by financial markets, there aren’t yet any major warning signs to suggest that the delta variant—or  whatever mutations might follow—will be enough to snuff out the recovery. Economic models based on market inputs show that the chance of another recession in the near future is very slim. A model created by Bloomberg strategist Cameron Crise puts the probability of recession in the next 12 months at just 7%. Frothy valuations do give many fundamentally minded investors reason for caution. And the gray area of the post-Covid world is engulfing the playing field when it comes to both monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and fiscal spending stimulus from Congress—the two forces that brought the economy and the markets back from the brink last year. The pickup in short-term inflation has been  stronger than many expected, and provides talking points to argue against further stimulus for both Fed policymakers and politicians launching midterm-election campaigns in the coming months. (How severe a threat the delta variant poses to those talking points is anyone’s guess.) Undeniably, investors’ buy-the-dip instinct—honed by the experience of 2020—appears to be as  alive as ever. The July 20 rebound echoed one that followed a similar episode of jitters in June. That shouldn’t be too surprising, given how much cash American consumers and businesses have  socked away in the past 16 months. The personal savings rate in the U.S. averaged less than 7.5% in the five years before Covid hit. After surging to as high as 33.7% in April 2020, it’s still elevated at 12.4%. Before the pandemic, it hadn’t been that high since the early 1980s. Some $4.5 trillion remains stowed away in money market mutual funds, earning basically nothing. That amount has come down from its peak, but is still about one-quarter higher than before the pandemic. Another $17 trillion is on deposit with commercial banks, a record amount that’s 33% higher than at the same time of year in 2019. Where will all that cash get spent? Will there be splurges on airfare and hotels and gasoline for road trips? New return-to-work business attire in a larger size to accommodate waistlines that  grew a bit during the pandemic? Or will the re-emerging Covid threat mean it’s spent once again on sweatpants, Amazon impulse buys, streaming services, and maybe some furniture for the home office? For corporations, will their cash be put toward share buybacks, acquisitions, and research and development? Or used to keep the lights on in another dark period of Covid? The closely followed strategists at  JPMorgan Chase, led by Marko Kolanovic, say the market has overreacted to the threat of the delta variant. They argue that the latest flare-up of the virus should not lead to a return to lockdowns; while the  rise in cases is alarming, vaccinations have sharply cut the threat of death from the virus. And this should lead to a rebound in stocks that benefit from the reopening amid continued inflation and higher bond yields. For the non-pros, however, the sloppy summer market action provides a perfect time to reflect on the evergreen advice that diversification is the best way to avoid the heartburn that accompanies attempts to pick stocks that will beat the market. In other words: Just leave it in the index fund and enjoy what’s left of the summer. Read next: Ten Company Stocks to Watch in Q3 2021

Dan Purcell’s transformation into a content protection vigilante began several years ago, with a moment of personal reckoning. The Irish computer programmer was living in California when his girlfriend at the time persuaded him to perform live on Chaturbate, a site that hosts adult web shows. He did several webcasts with her before deciding it wasn’t for him. He moved on, went back to Ireland, and never thought about it again—until 2018, when his new girlfriend angrily presented him with the videos. “It was very embarrassing,” he says, “very, very, very humiliating.” Purcell had thought the videos would be streamed live, then disappear, but people had built programs to automatically record the webcam footage. He started a weekslong hunt for the culprits. Because he’d used his social media handle on Chaturbate—“I still want to beat myself upside the head for this”—he just searched for his own username, along with some obvious keywords. What he discovered was a sprawling online ecosystem of groups dedicated to reselling stolen adult content. And, eventually, a business opportunity. At first alone, then with a handful of part-time employees, Purcell began hiring himself out as a sleuth and enforcer, helping adult content creators find illegal copies of their photos and videos and get them taken down. Borrowing the Irish word for justice, he named his infant company Ceartas DMCA Ltd., with DMCA referring to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Purcell isn’t alone. As direct-to-consumer adult content has proliferated, an industry has emerged to try to police the piracy of it, including such services as DMCA.com, Rulta.com, and TakeDownPiracy.com. They’re filling a growing void at a moment when individuals have more power to create and post their own content online, but less power to control what happens to it. Figures like Purcell at times employ controversial methods: He says he once sifted through a 14-year-old’s Xbox Live account for personal details, then used the kid’s real name to pressure him into taking down stolen nudes and writing an apology letter. But his customers see him as their last, best option in an industry where tech platforms and the authorities can be slow to take action. Ceartas in particular owes its existence to  OnlyFans, a platform for creators to charge viewers for photos and videos. The company hosts a variety of people, from chefs to musicians to personal trainers, but its biggest stars are adult performers. OnlyFans, founded in London in 2016, has seen business  explode during the pandemic. Since 2019 the number of “fans” has increased more than tenfold to over 100 million, the company says. Last year, those fans paid about $2 billion for access to photos and videos, meaning OnlyFans took in about $400 million from its 20% cut. All told, creators on the site have made more than $4.5 billion, and more than 500 of them have individually made over $1 million.  OnlyFans is now said to be in talks to  raise funding at a valuation of more than $1 billion. But the skyward trajectory of OnlyFans and the rest of adult self-publishing is hindered by digital pirates, who force performers to compete with their own content elsewhere on the web for free. Take Joey Fisher. Since she was 19, she’s worked as what the British call a “glamour model”—a genteel term for entertainment that leaves little to the imagination. Fisher, 28, lives in Wales and joined OnlyFans about two years ago. The subscription fee ($15.40 a month for her channel) and tips from fans are generating the best income she’s ever made from modeling. Plus, she’s her own boss. The one problem, she says, is the piracy. A search for Fisher online produces dozens of porn web pages promoting images and videos ripped from her OnlyFans channel. Links promising stolen photos of her have proliferated on  Reddit, and chat platform  Discord servers tout access to images of her and other celebrity nudes for $9.99. Having her work reproduced always came with the territory. “Even when I shot for a magazine, those images would end up on porn websites or random forums,” she says. But because of Fisher’s time and investment in building her OnlyFans channel and expanding her subscriber base, the thefts bothered her that much more. “It’s your business, so the amount of time and effort that goes into it, and it just gets ripped off and put on the internet for free, it’s really infuriating,” Fisher says. When she would manage to get a photo taken down, it would just reappear elsewhere. “It’s just constantly search it, get it taken down, repeat.” Earlier this year, Fisher’s best friend recommended she contact Purcell, who, when he’s not pursuing adult content thieves, still works as an engineer at software company  ZenDesk Inc. They talked for an hour on the phone about the software Ceartas uses to trawl the web for pirated photos and how he adds some bite to warnings he sends to site hosts by invoking the DMCA. “Dan made me aware of multiple websites I’d never heard of before,” she says. She’s now one of Ceartas’s more than 60 clients, paying about $150 to $230 a month. Adult performers exist in a cultural and economic gray area. Because  Apple Inc. and  Google forbid erotic content apps on their platforms, OnlyFans is accessible only through a web browser, not a mobile device. Not having an app means that OnlyFans can’t build in certain protective features—like the tool  Netflix Inc. uses to black out a user’s screen when a clipping service is detected. Performers’ lone recourse is often to fill out a form on the company’s site registering their grievances. Purcell’s first big case after his own was in November 2020, when a sprawling data dump of stolen photos appeared on the  servers of Discord. The database leak, which mainly contained intimate pictures of Irish women, was massive and searchable. In a statement about the incident, Discord said it took “immediate action” and “banned every user account involved.” Watching it unfold, though, Purcell saw a need for his skills. He asked performers he knew for images—“Every third girl I know was probably on OnlyFans,” he says—and posted them to one of the Discord servers. As a contributor, he quickly gained the trust of the people running the server. Then he emailed them a warning, falsely claiming that the police were on to them. It was enough to spook the administrator, who confessed in a message to Purcell that he was a teenager and immediately took down the server. The operation took less than an hour. Purcell had found his calling. OnlyFans, for its part, has every reason to help creators keep their private images off other sites. In a response to emailed questions, a spokesperson said the company is “firmly in the fight to protect user content.” When it pursues stolen images, the “takedown success rates are extremely high.” The takedown services are free, and the company has “invested significantly” in the team that works on them, the spokesperson said. Yet the thefts persist, as do independent efforts to stop them. Right now, Ceartas is still a tiny operation. Purcell has been speaking with potential investors to expand his business while working out of the back of his aunt’s house, where he lives. Soon he hopes to focus on the company full time. As his business has increased, Purcell says he’s automated a lot of the searches and takedown notices, and he only rarely uses the social engineering tricks that got him started. Recently he even hired a lawyer to go with the email address, legal@weareceartas.com, he’s long used to send out his warnings. “Any company can have a legal department,” he says. “Doesn’t mean you’re a practicing attorney.”

Officials overseeing the U.S. transition away from the London interbank offered rate say they expect to endorse a long-awaited forward-looking term structure tied to the discredited benchmark’s primary replacement in the coming days. The Federal Reserve-backed Alternative Reference Rates Committee published recommendations on Wednesday for how market participants could best deploy term rates tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in order to transition away from Libor. The group, which has held off endorsing a derivatives-based term structure due to insufficient market liquidity, said it plans to do so shortly after the July 26 swaps-market shift of interdealer trading conventions to SOFR, according to the statement.

The Tokyo Olympics is facing the first major test of its Covid protocols, after three people linked to the South African men’s soccer team tested positive for the coronavirus and put into jeopardy its match against Japan scheduled the day before the opening ceremony. Two players and one video analyst from the South African side have tested positive, and 18 others from the delegation who had been in close contact are in isolation. South Africa now has to put together a squad of at least 13 people who can clear health protocols for Thursday’s match.

While it’s long been clear that victims of sexual harassment often face retaliation that can damage their careers, the financial cost they shoulder has been difficult to quantify. To put a number on it, a study published Wednesday by Time’s Up and the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), “Paying Today and Tomorrow,” sought to nail down what people who had been harassed ended up paying. Victims interviewed faced expenses anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The Bank of Russia spent years convincing citizens that it could bring inflation under control. A few months of surging prices has been enough to demolish that progress. “There was a short period when inflation fell out of the top three problems worrying the population,” said Valery Fedorov, head of state-run pollster VTsIOM. “People didn’t have time to believe in it.”

Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. drivers in major U.S. cities staged a strike on Wednesday demanding better pay and the right to unionize, a sign of the intensifying fight by gig workers for more labor protections. The demonstrations, organized by Rideshare Drivers United, call for drivers and passengers to turn off Uber and Lyft apps on Wednesday and boycott services to advocate for better pay, working conditions and the ability organize and collectively bargain. Rallies were scheduled in cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Denver and Baltimore and Austin, Texas.

The Democratic National Committee raised $87.1 million over the first six months of the year, more than its Republican counterpart, according to its latest filing with the Federal Election Commission. Combined with the $3.8 million haul of its Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, which supports the national and state party committees, the DNC raised more in the first half of 2021 than it did in all of 2017. The two raised $14.4 million in June, and ended the month with $67.6 million cash on hand, less than the GOP.

Raytheon merged with United Technologies to create a $123 billion  aerospace and defense behemoth just as the pandemic was  grounding flights. Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes thinks travel will never be the same.  How does the economic growth trajectory look to you over the next six to 12 months?Great. We have two businesses: a commercial aerospace business which was just devastated last year, down 50%. And then we have a very, very big defense business. Both of those businesses are going to experience growth in the next 12 months, in the next two or three years. What do you anticipate for business travel?We’re starting to see it pick up. But certainly business travel is forever changed, because of Zoom. Our own view is you probably don’t see a full recovery in business travel until 2024, 2025. I hope we’re wrong. The deal between Raytheon and United Technologies was enormous. What did you learn?We had an aerospace and defense business at UTC, which was about $45 billion, merging with a $25 billion business focused primarily on defense. Interestingly, what we found was that the cultures weren’t all that different. What technological breakthrough will have the biggest impact on the defense industry?It could be hypersonic weapons. We’ve talked about stealth for the last 30 years, but speed trumps stealth when you’re talking about something that can go up to Mach 20, which is about 17,000 miles an hour. The ability to defend against hypersonics is the huge market. What do you think of the  billionaires going into space?I think what they have done with the commercialization of space transport is phenomenal. Space tourism will be a niche market for a long time at $250,000 a ride, for maybe 10 or 15 years, which is about my planning horizon. Then I’ll be too old to worry about it. Interviews are edited for clarity and length.

The Marina Bay Sands casino in Singapore will shut for two weeks after authorities detected a Covid cluster, the latest to emerge after an outbreak at a fishery port that pushed the government to reimpose social restrictions. Eleven Covid cases have been linked to the casino owned by Las Vegas Sands Corp, prompting the decision to close until August 5 for deep cleaning and to break the spread of the virus, the Health Ministry said on Thursday. Testing will be done on all staff working at the casino, which is part of a larger complex including a hotel, dining and luxury shopping mall.

At least 800 people in Uganda received fake Covid-19 vaccines in June from “unscrupulous people” as employers rushed to inoculate workers amid a spike in infections. Some companies paid fees to have their employees vaccinated from their work premises, but the medical officials turned out to be fraudsters administering largely water, according to Warren Naamara, the director of State House Health Monitoring Unit.

Leading up to and during the presidency of Donald Trump, Tom Barrack, founder of investment firm Colony Capital Inc., sold Trump to skeptical Wall Street titans, lauded him at the Republican National Convention, helped lead his transition team, and raised $107 million as chairman of the inaugural committee that organized the celebrations marking Trump’s ascendance. He was also, according to federal prosecutors, an unregistered agent for the United Arab Emirates. His  arrest on Tuesday is the latest blow in a long comedown for Barrack, who at 74 still radiates the tanned good health of a man who plays polo and makes wine. He lent decades of credibility built on Wall Street to Trump’s campaign and presidency, a deal that has now gone bad. Much of the trouble stems from his proclivity for comity even when there’s little room for it, as well as blindness to the failings of the royals and magnates with whom he fraternized. For most of his life, Barrack enjoyed playing the role of the CEO statesman, with geopolitics and cross-border investments intermingling freely. But that proposition became legally tenuous when he suddenly had direct access to America’s commander-in-chief. It was difficult to determine what role Barrack was embodying at any given time—private businessman, de facto diplomat, trusted friend of the president—amid a swirl of deal talks across the globe. When   Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2018 on Barrack’s involvement in Middle East affairs, Colony representatives did their best to thread the needle: “Barrack as chairman is responsible for creating a macro vision and expanding the global brand,” an outside spokesman for the company said. “Politics around the world is an integral part of developing a vision.” The indictment filed in federal court in Brooklyn lays out allegations that Barrack was especially focused on developing the vision of high-level Emirati officials in Washington. Working with an assistant, Matthew Grimes, and Emirati businessman Rashid Al Malik, he talked up UAE views during TV appearances and pushed them to the Trump campaign and administration, the indictment says. Some of the dates mentioned in the indictment correspond with dates when Bloomberg TV aired interviews with Barrack. In May 2016, Al Malik communicated that an Emirati official had confirmed that Barrack would be “the only channel” to Trump. Eleven months later, Barrack told Al Malik in a text message that Trump was weighing giving him yet another role, this time as an ambassador or envoy, which “would give Abu Dhabi more power!”—a reference to the capital of the Emirates. Al Malik replied, “This will be great for us. And make you deliver more. Very effective operation.” The role never materialized, despite Barrack having served as head of the inaugural committee, a job he likened to that of a wedding planner. (It had its perks: Al Malik got an invitation to the black-tie dinner hosted by Barrack that featured a red-wine blend from his California vineyard and performances by a Las Vegas dance troupe.) The indictment charged Barrack with failing to register as an agent, as well as obstruction of justice and lying to federal officials during a 2019 interview. He was taken into federal custody in California pending a bail hearing on Monday. Matthew Herrington, Barrack’s lawyer, said that his client is innocent and that he voluntarily made himself available to investigators. The Foreign Agents Registration Act was designed to bolster transparency and help Americans better understand when foreign actors are pushing information or policy. The law has proved troublesome for other Trump associates, including former Trump campaign chairman  Paul Manafort and former Trump fundraiser  Elliott Broidy. Both were  pardoned by the former president. It’s Broidy, the other Los Angeles-based investor turned Trump donor and UAE backer, who has always drawn the quickest contrasts from Barrack’s friends. Broidy pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate FARA. Prosecutors said he was paid millions of dollars for work that included lobbying the government to drop the investigation into the 1Malaysia Development Bhd Fund. The Barrack indictment makes no mention of compensation for his advocacy of the Emiratis. He has always thrived in a more genteel world of kind deeds and thoughtful favors. Colony Capital continued to receive investments from Emirati investors during the Trump presidency, and in 2019 the company closed a fund that included its first investment from the  Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, a close Emirati ally. As Trump prepared to take office in 2017, Colony completed a disastrous merger that would send shares plummeting. And Barrack’s relationship with the UAE was set to put the company in a deeper bind. In June 2017 the UAE and Saudi Arabia blockaded Qatar, one of Colony’s biggest investors. Qatar’s neighbors accused it of supporting terrorism, a claim it denied but that Trump backed. Barrack, who has known Trump since the 1980s when he arranged to sell him the Plaza Hotel, makes a point of talking about how he’s friends with everyone. He’s conflict-averse and is especially accommodating to royal families that steer large sovereign wealth funds. Barrack had helped the Qataris gain control of Claridge’s hotel in London, coordinated the construction of a sheikh-size Bel Air mansion, and bolstered their stateside political ties. But now the Emiratis and Saudis were using their influence in the Trump White House to isolate Barrack’s old friends in Qatar. Suddenly Barrack was less ecstatic about pushing the Emirati position. According to the indictment, he proposed to Al Malik that representatives from the UAE, Qatar, and other governments meet at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland where Egypt and Israel hammered out a Nobel Prize-winning peace agreement. Al Malik “did not believe such a meeting was in the interests” of the UAE, the indictment says. When that went nowhere, Barrack found himself in the awkward position of having to play both sides. He told the Washington Post that he was sometimes “shocked” by the president’s rhetoric and that he had advised Trump not to get involved in the blockade. But that required its own damage control. According to prosecutors, Barrack then told Al Malik that the newspaper had failed to include positive statements he’d made about a person identified in the indictment as “Emirati Official 1,” an apparent reference to Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. Things did not look up from there. In 2019, as the world condemned Saudi Arabia for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Barrack told Milken Institute conference attendees it would be a mistake to judge the Saudis for that. (He later described the killing as “atrocious.”) Then Jared Kushner unveiled, and received the plaudits for, a détente between the UAE, Israel, and Saudi Arabia that Barrack had pitched years earlier. By early 2020, shares of Colony had fallen 80% from their peak, triggering an activist letter that described Barrack as a “remote, part-time CEO” and called for his ouster. Despite holding about 2% of the company’s shares, the activist, a little-known company called  Blackwells Capital LLC, won four board seats. Barrack  stepped down, first as chief executive officer in 2020 and then as executive chairman earlier this year. The company has been renamed  DigitalBridge Group Inc., more befitting of its new focus on infrastructure such as cell towers and data centers, a line of work that one Barrack friend says he found boring. Amid the strategy shift, shares have more than doubled since a replacement CEO was announced. In an  interview on July 13 with Bloomberg TV’s Erik Schatzker, Barrack, dressed in dark jeans and a gray, long-sleeve top by Zegna, didn’t give any indication that he knew an arrest was coming. In fact he was starting a new family office that would work with investors in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. It would be called Falcon Peak, an apparent reference to the national bird of the Emirates. “The region,” he said, “is so complicated.” Read next: Trump’s Mar-A-Lago and the Florida Coast Become a GOP Power Base

Forget about a summit between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping: The U.S. and China had trouble even agreeing on the protocol for a meeting between senior diplomats. A spat over who on the Chinese side was an equivalent rank to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman for her visit to Asia in July became the latest sign of how far relations have plummeted. The dispute betrays deeper concerns and mistrust as well as the murkiness of who’s really important in Beijing. Sherman’s Asia tour has included on-again-off-again plans for China before the State Department confirmed meetings in the port city of Tianjin on July 25 and 26. The U.S. diplomat will meet with officials including State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. That announcement came after the Financial Times reported that her travel plans were halted because she had been offered a meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng, whom the U.S. didn’t consider her counterpart. The wrangle came two months after China’s state-backed Global Times criticized U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for snubbing an offer to speak with the defense minister. The newspaper cited a source that accused the U.S. of disregarding diplomatic protocol and committing an “unprofessional and unfriendly act” by instead seeking talks with the vice chairman of China’s Central Military Commission.

The aftershocks of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union are still being felt in Gibraltar, the rocky outcrop at Spain’s southern tip that’s been British for three centuries. Its 2.35 billion-pound ($3.2 billion) services-based economy is dependent on the untrammeled flow of frontier workers and other visitors coming in from Spain -- the type of free movement that Brexit was meant to limit. Rules guiding border protocols are still in flux, even after the EU and the U.K. sealed their divorce. The 6.8-square-kilometer enclave is a self-governing British overseas territory, like Bermuda or the Falklands Islands. As such, most of its 34,000 residents are British citizens, who voted almost unanimously in a 2002 referendum to remain under sole British sovereignty. At the same time, Gibraltar is physically part of Europe’s mainland, with deep ties to neighboring Spain -- which questions the legal basis of the U.K.’s claims to the territory ceded to Britain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. In the 2016 Brexit referendum narrowly won by anti-EU forces, 96% of Gibraltarians voted in favor of remaining in the EU.

Angela Merkel said that the next German chancellor will have to pick up the pace of technological progress to ensure Europe’s biggest economy can remain competitive in the digital age. Speaking at an extended press conference Thursday before what will be her last summer break as German leader, Merkel said that the next government will have to do more to digitize the public sector, help businesses take advantage of cutting edge technology and accelerate the effort to eliminate carbon emissions. Microphone malfunctions in the press room underlined the fact that for all its engineering prowess, Germany still struggles with the basics at times. “We could be better,” Merkel said. “There’s a lot to do.” While Merkel has seen solid economic growth add more than 5 million jobs during her 16 years in office, she’s stepping down at a time of when questions are mounting about the country’s future. The fabled German car industry is wrestling with the end of combustion engines and competition from the likes of Tesla, the German tech industry lags behinds its European rivals and manufacturers are fretting about the cost of the energy transition. Read More: Five Big Problems Merkel Is Leaving Next German Leader to Tackle The chancellor, who met with President Joe Biden in Washington last week, said that she had taken note of U.S. plans to spend some $250 billion on technology research, including chip development. ”We’re a strong country and have shown that during the coronavirus crisis,” she said. “But we have work to do in several areas to maintain the standard that we have and the world is developing with an incredible dynamic.” Merkel’s CDU remains on track to lead the next government, but the devastating floods that have battered the country over the past week have shifted the dynamic in the election campaign. Conservative front-runner Armin Laschet damaged his efforts when he was caught laughing on camera in the midst of the catastrophe. Laschet’s conservative bloc topped the latest poll from Forsa on 28%, nine points ahead of the Greens, in the first survey to gauge voters’ reaction to the flooding. A week earlier, Laschet had been leading by 11 points. Germany's conservatives have seen their lead in the polls narrow Source: Forsa poll  The country’s first woman leader and the first from formerly communist East Germany has won four straight German elections as head of the center-right Christian Democrats. If the coalition negotiations following September’s vote stretch on past Christmas, she’ll surpass Helmut Kohl to become Germany’s longest-serving postwar chancellor. Her last victory, in 2017, was strained by a lackluster result six months of tumultuous talks before she could form a government with the Social Democrats. In 2018, after political fight over refugees that nearly brought down her administration, she announced she wouldn’t run again as CDU party chairwoman or chancellor. How Germany’s Greens Moved From Fringe to Contenders Merkel has done much to tout her ambitious climate agenda, and in her first term she was dubbed “the green chancellor” (she was environment minister in the 1990s). But her record is more mixed. In 2011, she was forced to reverse a nearly-complete plan to extend nuclear energy by a decade in the fallout of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Her 2019 plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of this decade ran into opposition from climate activists and the opposition, who said it wasn’t ambitious enough. “A number of things are in effect, but much has to go faster,” she said Thursday. Similarly, she did little to encourage German automakers to embrace the shift to electric motors until the diesel scandal of 2015 forced their hand.  One of the biggest questions looming over the post-Merkel era is how involved the new government will be in driving the country’s economy. Merkel pursued a balanced-budget regime, known as the Black Zero -- often praised by supporters before the pandemic as it drove debt levels far below those of Germany’s peers. Yet she also often faced criticism for not making better use of fiscal space when the economy could afford it. With the pandemic, budget restraint was largely tossed aside as Merkel’s government spent hundreds of billions of euros to keep jobs and companies afloat amid lockdowns. The question now is whether to reinstate it. Compared to its European neighbors, Germany’s economy fared relatively well throughout the crisis, largely due to massive government support. The question is how businesses will fare once aid is withdrawn. — With assistance by Carolynn Look

Bly, Ore. (AP) -- Lower winds and better weather helped crews using bulldozers and helicopters battling the nation’s largest wildfire in southern Oregon, but gusty winds pushed a Northern California wildfire into Nevada on Thursday, prompting evacuations as blazes burn across the West. Oregon’s Bootleg Fire grew to 624 square miles (1,616 square kilometers) — over half the size of Rhode Island. However, authorities said higher humidity Wednesday and overnight and better conditions allowed crews to improve fire lines. The fire also was approaching an area burned by a previous fire on its active southeastern flank, raising hopes that a lack of fuel could reduce its spread, and the forecast was for favorable firefighting weather again Thursday.

Earlier this month, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto unveiled Move PGH, a program that aims to unite transportation services for non-drivers into a single platform. By opening Transit app, program participants will soon be able to plan and buy trips on public transit and bikeshare, as well as rides on shared electric scooters from Spin, by-the-hour vehicle rentals from Zipcar, e-mopeds from Scoobi, and carpooling via Waze. In exchange for participating in Move PGH, each of those companies has received a city permit unavailable to its competitors. The city is also working with Spin to concentrate mobility services around 50 physical hubs scattered throughout the city. “We’re making it super intuitive to open up a single app, with everything in one place,” says Karina Ricks, director of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. She hopes Move PGH helps residents avoid worrying if they miss the bus or can’t find an e-scooter: “If my Plan A falls through, there’s a Plan B and Plan C to get me where I need to go.” Ultimately, she envisions Move PGH allowing more people to leave their car at home, or even get rid of it entirely. A second program within Move PGH will provide “Universal Basic Mobility” to a few dozen low-income Pittsburghers — a free subscription to a package of mobility services. Ricks envisions eventually offering a paid version of that program to the general population. In the meantime, experts from Carnegie Mellon University and the Urban Institute have been tapped to evaluate Move PGH’s progress. There is a name for Move PGH’s underlying idea of bundling together urban mobility services: “Mobility as a Service,” or MaaS. Since MaaS’s flashy emergence in the mid-2010s, its supporters have painted an enticing vision of car-light cities where residents hop effortlessly between bus, bike, scooter and train. With concerns about automobiles’ contributions to climate change rising — and with many cities building new bike lanes and busways during the pandemic — MaaS could be poised to break out. If that happens, it will be a turnaround story. Cities from Berlin to Los Angeles to Tokyo have already experimented with MaaS, without clear evidence yet that many people changed their travel behavior as a result. As Pittsburgh becomes the latest city to give MaaS a shot, it’s a good time to apply lessons gleaned from its birthplace: Finland. The term “MaaS” was coined in a Finnish university in 2014, and the Finnish government even passed a national law intended to boost adoption. But today, Finland’s MaaS journey seems to be running aground. Only a tiny share of the country’s urban trips there are booked on MaaS platforms, and the companies providing them appear to be struggling. Meanwhile, the leading Finnish MaaS provider is at loggerheads with the nation’s biggest transit authority. If MaaS can’t succeed in its Nordic backyard, does it have a chance in a place like the Steel City? On the surface, Finland’s capital of Helsinki seems like exactly the kind of place where MaaS should thrive. The city easily clears the first hurdle of a successful MaaS deployment: It offers so much transit service and cycling infrastructure that going car-free is a realistic option. Only one in three city residents even owns a personal vehicle. “As soon as I came here, I sold my car and bought a transit pass and a bike,” says Aalto University engineering professor Milos Mladenovic, who began researching MaaS when he moved to Finland from the U.S. Urban Finns are deeply multimodal; prior to the pandemic more than half of Helsinki regional residents used transit at least once a week, and biking remains popular even during the long, dark winters (the city has a program to keep cycle lanes clear of snow and ice). Finland also has a history of embracing technology and digitalization; in the 1990s the country rode the tech boom, with Nokia as its standard bearer. Finnish graduate student Sonja Heikkila’s 2014 master’s thesis about MaaS is widely cited as the origin of the term (similar ideas, like Transportation as a Service, were already bouncing around), and the concept quickly found a receptive audience among climate-conscious Finns. In 2017 the national government passed the landmark Act on Transport Services, which required all transportation providers — both private companies and public transit authorities — to share data with one another and enable other parties to sell their trips. By positioning itself on MaaS’s leading edge, Finnish leaders hoped to both encourage clean, multimodal transportation while nurturing a potentially exportable industry. One Finn sensing opportunity was Sampo Hietanen, who was Heikkila’s thesis advisor. In 2015 he founded MaaS Global, a Helsinki-based startup that has raised more than 60 million euros ($70.8 million) to develop and market Whim, a MaaS platform offering the option of buying a la carte tickets or packaged mobility subscriptions. For instance, one current Whim product provides Helsinki residents with unlimited transit and short taxi trips, as well as a fixed amount of bikeshare trips and discounted carshare — all for a monthly cost of 62.70 euros. But tensions quickly flared between MaaS Global and HSL, the transit authority of the Helsinki region. HSL has its own mobile ticketing app, and MaaS advocates worried the transit authority was undermining the nascent MaaS market in order to keep riders on its own app. First MaaS Global accused HSL of refusing to share easy access to its popular monthly transit passes. Then the company appealed to the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority in the hopes of collecting “service fees” over and above the face value of a transit ticket. (That appeal is ongoing.) Meanwhile, the Covid pandemic has battered the national mobility industry. Finnish MaaS company Kyyti recently announced that it would cease operations, while MaaS Global has undergone two rounds of layoffs, Hietanen says. A recent investigation in Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (English translation here) described a company hemorrhaging money, pursuing expansions in Japan, Britain and Belgium despite failing to gain traction in its home market. (Hietanen says that the article exaggerated the company’s financial difficulties.) According to HSL, Finland’s MaaS platforms have never accounted for more than 2% of regional transit ticket sales; in the first six months of 2021, that figure has been just over 1%. Maas sales (which are dominated by Whim) fell 72% during the last two years, exceeding the 51% drop across all HSL tickets. “Subscriptions are virtually impossible during lockdowns,” says Hietanen. “No one commits to anything.” “We’re only seven years in. Look at how messy regulations were seven years after cars were first on the road.” Minna Soininen, the director of the Finnish Transport Association, brushes aside any suggestion that the friction with HSL could have contributed to MaaS’s struggles in her country. “We’ve known for five-plus years, if something goes wrong with MaaS, transit will be blamed,” she says. “How Whim is doing is mostly about whether people appreciate their product.” Indeed, reaching widespread usage seems like a high bar for any MaaS platform to clear. Having all your transportation options in one app is certainly convenient, but it might not be enough to change your travel decisions. “What’s the extra mile I would get from a MaaS app?” asks Mladenovic, the Aalto University professor. “Maybe I’d use it if the MaaS app gave me cheaper prices than I could get elsewhere, but that’s just burning money.” Case in point: In London, the MaaS startup Citymapper used some of its funds to offer transit passes cheaper than Transport for London was selling them. Consumer-facing MaaS startups outside of Finland have also been having a rocky time. Zipster, a MaaS platform in Singapore, recently shut down, and Citymapper has turned to crowdsourcing in order to raise fresh funds. Covid lockdowns haven’t helped, but MaaS’s struggles predate the pandemic. As I’ve argued before in Bloomberg CityLab, it’s tough to build a viable business aggregating tiny commissions from individual trips costing only a few euros or dollars each. Other MaaS models are possible, like selling services to employers rather than individuals or licensing a MaaS platform to transit agencies. But it isn’t clear that those models have been any more effective at inducing mode shift away from driving. Philippe Crist, an advisor for innovation at the OECD’s International Transport Forum, believes MaaS’s story is still just beginning. “We’re only seven years in,” he says. “Look at how messy regulations were seven years after cars were first on the road.” The principal author of a recent report on MaaS trends worldwide, Crist recommends that countries allow transit authorities to sell MaaS companies discounted bundles of low-demand tickets (at off-peak times, for instance). That would let MaaS providers to sell those tickets in creative ways, potentially making a profit in the process. Crist also argues that MaaS cannot succeed in Finland — or anywhere — without a transparent governance structure that prevents transit authorities and private companies from falling into a spiral of dysfunction. Mladenovic agrees, calling for “interpretative flexibility” in order to settle disputes. “We need some kind of semipublic forum for these urban debates,” he says, “as opposed to shooting at each other through the media.” For Pittsburgh, the good news is that Move PGH seems to have strong oversight built into its model. The city itself will manage the program, and Ricks says her agency will be ready to resolve conflicts that might emerge (the city has leverage, since it is issuing exclusive permits to Move PGH’s private sector participants). Pittsburgh’s local transit authority is only now adopting mobile ticketing, so tensions like those in Helsinki between HSL and MaaS Global seem unlikely. Move PGH also offers ticketing across a broader range of mobility services than any prior U.S. MaaS deployment: Only ride-hailing service is currently lacking. Notably, Pittsburgh’s program will ultimately include a network of 50 physical mobility hubs throughout the city. The hubs will feature micromobility charging stations from Swiftmile and multimodal wayfinding screens from TransitScreen. (Disclosure: I’m an adviser to TransitScreen.) Details are yet to come, but such hubs could both facilitate easy transfers across modes and act as billboards for Move PGH’s suite of services. But a big question remains: Will Move PGH be enough to convince many Pittsburghers not to drive? The city set a target for halving its transportation-related emissions and vehicle miles traveled by 2030 in its 2018 climate action plan; to meet that goal, transit and bike usage will need to grow dramatically. Currently, according to the 2019 American Community Survey, 17% of local commutes take place on transit and 2% by bicycle. Those numbers exceed those of many other similarly sized American cities, but pale in comparison to a European hub of multimobility like Helsinki. That’s unsurprising when you compare service availability: Pittsburgh’s three light-rail lines, for example, come every 15 to 30 minutes in the middle of the day; Helsinki’s Metro system provides trains every 2 to 4 minutes. Move PGH is still getting up and running, but Spin, which corralled many of its private sector partners, is ready to export the idea. “We’re already thinking about how to bring this model to other cities,” says Ben Bear, Spin’s CEO. I asked Mladenovic what advice he would give any U.S. urban leader thinking about following Pittsburgh’s example and embracing MaaS as a way to reduce driving. He smiled, giving his answer in the form of a question: “What is the frequency of your transit service?”

The 37th annual awards ceremony will now take place on Sunday, March 6, three weeks before the Academy Awards on March 27, the nonprofit organization Film Independent said Thursday. The Spirit Awards have long been held on the Saturday before the Oscars as a casual, beachside, afternoon fete. While the show won’t be able to benefit from attendees already in town for the Oscars, it does mean the awards could now influence Oscars voting.

Blizzard Entertainment's disastrous remake of the classic video game Warcraft III last year was the result of mismanagement and financial pressures, according to newly revealed documents and people with knowledge of the failed launch. The release also reflected Blizzard’s significant cultural changes in recent years, as corporate owner  Activision Blizzard Inc. has pushed the developer to cut costs and prioritize its biggest titles. Warcraft III: Reforged was a long-awaited reimagining of one of Blizzard’s most popular games. Blizzard President J. Allen Brack called the original title “monumentally important” when Reforged was announced in 2018. The company promised “over four hours of updated in-game cutscenes and re-recorded voice-overs.” But the project was never a priority for the company, in part because a remaster of an old strategy game had little chance of becoming the type of billion-dollar product that Activision wanted, according to the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on company matters. With Blizzard pressured to focus on its biggest franchises, Warcraft III: Reforged couldn’t get the ambitious budget that its leaders wanted.

It’s something I’ve suspected for several years and suggested sotto voce to friends, but now can say out loud: New York City has better Indian food than London. I say this after a few dinners at Dhamaka. The latest collaboration between restaurateur Roni Mazumdar and chef Chintan Pandya is the ras-malai, the end-of-meal sweet, that rounds off the perfect maha-bhoj, or grand feast, of the city’s Indian dining options. I can drill down to a single dish that confirms New York’s primacy: the baked rabbit known as Rajasthani khargosh.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the top publicly traded copper miner, produced less than expected last quarter, offering a boost to prices of the metal that had retreated from record highs. The Phoenix-based company reported second-quarter output of 913 million pounds, trailing the 961 million-pound average estimate among analysts. While Freeport reiterated its annual sales forecast and output is well above year-ago levels, copper sales came in below Freeport’s own projection due to the timing of shipments.

As demand for clean energy surges, would-be developers are struggling to find enough transmission lines to carry power to the people. One increasingly popular solution: retired coal plants. Much as a special-purpose acquisition company offers entrepreneurs quick access to public markets, a retired power facility offers renewable energy producers a back door onto the grid. Denmark’s Orsted AS, for instance, is developing a 1.1-gigawatt wind farm off the New Jersey coast that’s expected to go into service in 2024. The turbines will be at least 15 miles (24 kilometers) from shore, and Orsted plans to connect them to the grid at two onshore sites, a coal plant that retired last year and a nuclear plant that was shuttered in 2018.

President Joe Biden hosted business and labor leaders at the White House on Thursday as a bipartisan group of senators neared an agreement that would allow the chamber to begin debating infrastructure legislation. Biden stressed how notable it was that two sides used to being at odds had instead joined together to back the bipartisan infrastructure framework. “They’re not here to negotiate with one another,” he said. Rather, “they’re supporting what we’re trying to get done in infrastructure.”

An interval of eight to 10 weeks between doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE boosts the effectiveness of the two-shot regimen compared with a shorter interval, a U.K. study found. “Eight weeks is probably the sweet spot,” in terms of the trade-off between getting as many people fully vaccinated as quickly as possible and allowing the population to produce higher antibody levels, professor Susanna Dunachie, the study lead from the University of Oxford, said at a briefing Thursday.

Biogen Inc. fought back against criticism of the unusual circumstances that led to the U.S. approval of its Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm, saying in an open letter it has been the subject of “extensive misinformation and misunderstanding.” Aduhelm, approved in June, is controversial because it hasn’t been shown to slow cognitive decline. Two big tests were stopped early by Biogen and ended up producing contradictory results. But the Food and Drug Administration still gave it an accelerated clearance on the basis of its ability to remove an abnormal protein called amyloid from the brain.

FirstEnergy Corp. surged the most in more than five months Thursday after the Ohio utility reached an agreement with federal prosecutors over a corruption case involving a $1 billion state bailout for nuclear power plants. Under a deferred-prosecution agreement announced Thursday, FirstEnergy admitted that it conspired with public officials and others to pay millions of dollars in bribes. The company agreed to pay $230 million, the largest criminal penalty ever imposed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio.

Bitcoin’s recovery this week after briefly dipping below $30,000 continues a pattern of rebounds when trading nears the 55-week moving average. The latest bounce reflects the third time since late 2019 that the largest cryptocurrency found support at that key level, including a year ago just ahead of a massive rally. By contrast, Bitcoin suffered extended losses after closing below the indicator in March 2020, and tumbled in 2018 when the price failed to break above the technical benchmark, the data show.

Des Moines, Iowa (AP) -- Democrat Abby Finkenauer, a former congresswoman, is running for Republican Chuck Grassley's U.S. Senate seat, hoping her blue-collar credentials will propel her forward in a state that has grown more conservative over the years. The 32-year-old former state lawmaker, who announced her candidacy by video Thursday morning, would offer a stark contrast to the 87-year-old Grassley, who was elected to his first term in the Senate eight years before Finkenauer was born.

With Covid-19 shots reaching billions of people, reports have grown more common of people getting infected with the coronavirus despite being vaccinated. Just as a natural infection doesn’t guarantee protection from reinfection with the virus, neither does immunization provide a perfect shield. Still, those who have immunity -- either from vaccination or infection -- carry a fraction of the risk of those who have none. So-called breakthrough cases among the immunized are a reminder that as long as the pandemic virus is prevalent in the world, it remains a threat to everyone. First, it’s important to remember that testing positive indicates an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that can cause Covid-19. The disease is diagnosed only when the infection causes symptoms such as fever and cough; a significant proportion of people who become infected never develop symptoms. Although vaccines provide a strong defense against severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, none fully protects against the infection, meaning many vaccinated people are still at risk of catching the virus and of transmitting it to other people. The more SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in a community, the higher the chance of infection. In some instances, those infections will break through the protective shield that vaccine-induced immunity provides to cause Covid symptoms. In rare cases, the illness may be life-threatening. Another possible risk is so-called long Covid -- lasting fatigue, breathlessness and other symptoms seen in an estimated 1 in 10 Covid survivors; it’s unknown how well vaccines prevent these lingering problems.

While the U.K. races ahead treating patients suffering from the long-term effects of Covid-19, the U.S. is falling behind as a result of its  decentralized health care system.  “Long Covid” — which surfaced after the first wave in spring 2020 — is estimated to afflict nearly a quarter of all patients, with symptoms such as chronic fatigue, muscle aches and brain fog persisting for weeks or even months.

Drought is withering crops on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border, prompting farmers to take the rare measure of baling up their wheat and barley stems to sell as hay. The bales are providing much-needed forage for livestock operators struggling against a lack of pasture and soaring feed costs, and also signal smaller grain harvests that could keep crop prices high in the months to come. Temperatures are expected to soar next week in the Great Plains, further threatening parched farm fields.

Africa must emulate India and produce more of its own vaccines, said Strive Masiyiwa, the telecommunications billionaire assigned to help the continent secure Covid-19 shots. If vaccine suppliers “want a long-term future with us,” they should manufacture their products on the continent, the African Union special envoy told a media briefing on Thursday. “When we got into trouble this time, it was because there was no production from the African continent,” he said.

Unemployment in Taiwan surged in June as companies in the service sector and their workers bore the brunt of the government measures aimed at slowing the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. The unemployment rate jumped to 4.76%, the highest since November 2010 and well above the 4.25% median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. A record 81,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed in June, the largest month-on-month increase since the government began collecting data in 1978.

A hard turn to the left in South American politics may come with a silver lining for mining companies in the form of higher prices, according to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson. Policy uncertainty in Peru and Chile, which account for about 40% of global copper production, is supportive of future prices as producers balk on pulling the trigger on investments, he told analysts on a call Thursday. The shifting political winds are part of the challenges that mining companies face in meeting growing demand as the world transitions away from fossil fuels.

Southwest Airlines Co. said it was “hopeful” of returning to profitability in the third and fourth quarters, amid concerns over the financial impact of a coronavirus variant and a recent rash of flight delays. The potential for an adjusted profit excludes any benefit from billions of dollars in airline aid provided by the U.S. government, Southwest said Thursday as it reported second-quarter results. The carrier recorded a profit in June, not counting federal funds, its first since the pandemic began. Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. have both predicted a return to profit.

Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the Indian unit of Unilever Plc, missed analyst estimates for quarterly profit, hurt by rising raw material prices and a deadly second virus wave that crimped consumption demand. Asia’s biggest consumer goods firm by market value posted a 9.6% rise in net income that came in at 20.6 billion rupees ($277 million) for the quarter ended June 30, it said in an exchange filing Thursday. That compares with the 22.1-billion-rupee average profit forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue rose 13% to 117.3 billion rupees, while volume growth was 9%, the filing said.

Mississippi called on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, raising the stakes in a polarizing clash the justices are set to hear in the term that starts in October. In a court filing Thursday, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch called the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide, “egregiously wrong.” She said the case for overturning Roe and a 1992 follow-up ruling was “overwhelming.”

Singapore leaders have justified a recent anti-Covid crackdown by warning about the impact the virus could have on unvaccinated senior citizens. The data shows it’s younger people who are getting infected in greater numbers. The sharp rise in cases that sparked tighter group limits and the reimposition of a ban on dining-in has largely been affecting the city-state’s younger -- and least fully-vaccinated -- population, according to data from the Ministry of Health.

“Show, don’t tell,” has always been a guiding rule for writers. Now it’s also the advice being given to home appraisers as the industry comes to terms with its own biases.   Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, recently identified “problematic phrases” that should be avoided in appraisals — the valuation reports that it and others rely on to provide financing to would-be homeowners. Four examples of this language are listed in Fannie Mae’s June newsletter for appraisal professionals: “Crime-ridden area,” “desirable neighborhood,” “affordable neighborhood,” and “integrated community” are all considered bad for business now. Fannie Mae instead suggests more objective descriptions, like stating an area’s crime rate. This is all being done in service of the appraisal industry’s attempts to figure out how homes in predominantly Black neighborhoods routinely are priced at lower values than the same-sized and same-designed homes in white neighborhoods, even after accounting for neighborhood characteristics such as crime, poverty levels and proximity to amenities like parks. It’s what’s called appraisal bias or the appraisal gap, a problem that industry leaders were reluctant to acknowledge until very recently, despite decades of data showing such discrepancies.  Historically, federal housing officials and industry leaders encouraged appraisal professionals to judge home values by the color of the neighborhood rather than the house itself. Racial segregation directly informed how appraisers priced homes until the Fair Housing Act of 1965 and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 outlawed conditioning home values based on race. However, neighborhoods across the U.S. have since remained mostly racially segregated, and so real estate professionals have found ways — both intentionally and unintentionally — to traffic in home evaluations based on race even without needing to explicitly say anything about race.  The new Fannie Mae language guidance acknowledges this, which is why it suggests that using a term like “integrated community” in appraisal reports is loaded because it signals the racial demographics of a neighborhood. “The valuation should focus on the property, not the residents,” reads the guidance. The problematic phrases are part of Fannie Mae’s list of unacceptable appraisal practices from its Selling Guide, which includes developing valuation reports based “either partially or completely on the sex, race, color, religion, handicap, national origin, familial status, or other protected classes” of the people who own the house or live in the neighborhood. Even saying something as seemingly benign as “desirable neighborhood” is problematic, in part because “desirable” has been coded as “white” throughout much of housing market history.  Read More: Four Ways Disparities in Homeownership Persist University of New Mexico sociology professor Elizabeth Korver-Glenn explores this history and how it determines how housing is sold today in her 2021 book Race Brokers: Housing Markets and Segregation in 21st Century Urban America. For her research she interviewed more than 70 appraisers and real estate professionals to get a sense of their methods. “In particular, they believed that White neighborhoods were the best, most desirable neighborhoods and that neighborhoods of color were less desirable,” writes Korver-Glenn. “They also assumed that White buyers were the ‘typical buyers’ whose taste would determine what was and was not ‘desirable’ and that ‘typical buyers’ would match neighborhood race.” There’s data to back this up as well: A study that Korver-Glenn and fellow researcher Junia Howell published last year found that a neighborhood’s racial composition was a “stronger determinant” of housing values in 2015 than it was in 1980 — in other words, the racial appraisal gap has only widened. Language changes may be a suboptimal way of addressing the problem. Korver-Glenn’s research suggests that the bias is actually baked into the methods and practices of the industry. For example, a standard way for appraisers to determine a house’s value today is by looking at what houses in the surrounding neighborhood have sold for. But since racial segregation is still entrenched in most neighborhoods across the U.S., that means the 20th century undervaluing of homes in Black neighborhoods has been carried over into 21st century appraising — “desirability” and maximized home values are still tied to a neighborhood’s whiteness. Which is why Korver-Glenn says that the Fannie Mae guidance on problematic phrases misses the mark. In an interview with Bloomberg CityLab, she likened it to a cookbook publisher advising bakers to drop the word “chocolate” from their published chocolate chip cookie recipes after a hypothetical finding that chocolate was unhealthy. “This intentionally ridiculous scenario helps illustrate what is problematic about the ‘avoiding problematic phrases’ guidance: Absolutely nothing has changed about the recipe, its ingredients or its bake,” said Korver-Glenn. “Expecting a different cookie result by deleting the word ‘chocolate’ is as realistic as expecting a different [or] less racist appraisal result by deleting some problematic, racially coded phrases.”Read more: What It Will Take to Close the Race Gap in Home Appraisals Fannie Mae’s selling guide for appraisers still lists among its unacceptable practices: “failure to comment on negative factors with respect to the subject neighborhood, the subject property, or proximity of the subject property to adverse influences.” For Korver-Glenn, that is evidence that “they are encouraging appraisers to avoid some racially coded words while doing exactly nothing to address the racist logic and methods that infuse and animate” appraisal work. Leaders at the Appraisal Institute and the Appraisal Foundation — organizations that develop training and standards for the industry —  recently decided to study the appraisal gap issue and are looking to institute new industrywide reforms in the near future. Among those changes is the creation of a “Personal Characteristics and Valuation Practice” guidance, which encourages appraisers to “ignore and avoid ethnographic and other personal characteristics in property appraisals,” and a new five-hour training course on unconscious biases.But appraisals are only one part of the issue in the broader landscape of housing discrimination. Sarah Wheeler, editor-in-chief of HousingWire, a publication for housing professionals, wrote in a recent newsletter that the new language guidance from Fannie Mae is “great advice not just for appraisers, but real estate agents and lenders too.”

Executives at public companies are talking less and less about race-related issues during earnings calls, more than a year after the murder of George Floyd forced corporate America to  reckon with its own systemic bias. The usage of terms including “racism,” “equality” and “social justice” peaked on earnings calls for S&P 500 companies in the third quarter of 2020. Of those 500 calls, “racial injustice” was mentioned 36 times. Of the 118 calls that have taken place during the second quarter of this year, only one company — Adobe Inc. — used the term. There are 382 more calls left this earnings season.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack predicted the jump in U.S. food prices in June will quickly moderate despite rising concern about inflationary risks in the economy. “There are certain selective items in the grocery store folks may see for a period of time increased costs,” Vilsack said Friday in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power” with David Westin. “We think this will even out as we begin to recover, as we begin to get the supply and demand in better balance.”

European regulators cleared Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 shot for children aged 12 to 17, offering a second weapon in the push to vaccinate teenagers on the continent as the delta variant spreads. The authorization from the European Medicines Agency follows earlier green lights for the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE shot -- which like Moderna’s product is based on messenger-RNA technology -- for people of that age bracket. Health authorities are rushing to inoculate as many young people as possible in the coming weeks before schools reopen. Moderna shares rose as much as 4.7%.

What keeps breaking the buck, is engaged in financial transformation, and keeps on growing?The stablecoin market. The value of the top four stablecoins has surpassed $100 billion in the space of four years, and the coins — which trade on a blockchain but attempt to maintain a one-for-one peg with fiat currencies — now form an integral part of the crypto ecosystem, often acting as the collateral behind DeFi and enabling transfers between crypto exchanges. But as the market grows, it’s also coming under increased scrutiny in part because it’s still unclear how stablecoin issuers are maintaining their pegs. Most of the criticism has so far been directed at Tether, which claims that its tokens are 100% backed by reserves, though it has released few details of what those are exactly. If Tether’s account of its reserves is accurate, then it’s  now a massive player in the commercial paper market which has historically been dominated by large investors such as regulated money market funds (MMFs). This is the reason why JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Josh Younger describes stablecoins as being “the primary interaction point between the crypto-native and traditional financial systems through their reserve funds.” The suggestion is that if stablecoins were to experience disruption, it could reverberate into financial markets through the commercial paper channel, again depending on what issuers hold:  The definition of shadow banks is notoriously fuzzy, but it typically includes non-regulated entities engaged in maturity or liquidity transformation — that is securing short-term funds to invest in longer-term assets, or converting illiquid assets into more easily spendable money. On that basis, stablecoins could well be taking questionable reserve assets and converting them into stable digital cash.This isn’t a problem as long as the stablecoin market avoids huge bouts of redemptions. So far that has been the case, even in the sharp crypto sell-off in May. That’s somewhat surprising given that — by Younger’s calculations — the top four coins have ‘broken the buck’ (i.e. dipped below their peg) with some regularity; having spent the past 30% to 40% of the past three months trading below par. But an unexpected disruption risks causing problems for exchanges and issuers which provide the coins. That in turn could feed into the traditional financial system through the key funding market which is commercial paper, and again raises questions of  financial stability given that stablecoin issuers are unregulated. That’s one reason why officials at the Federal Reserve have been talking about stablecoins, with Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren recently keying in on their resemblance to traditional “but maybe riskier” prime money market funds.Back to Younger:

As the coronavirus sweeps across the globe in relentless waves, a succession of more-infectious strains has washed up. So far delta, the variant first reported in India in October, is the most worrisome. About twice as transmissible as the original virus that emerged in late 2019, delta combines a multitude of genetic features that have enabled it to pierce public-health defenses to stoke severe epidemics and trigger fresh rounds of movement restrictions or delay planned easings of them. It’s the most infectious variant of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid, to emerge yet -- about 55% more transmissible than alpha, the previously most-infectious form, and almost twice as contagious as other circulating strains. The World Health Organization expects delta to rapidly outcompete other coronavirus variants and become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 globally in coming months.

Environmental ministers from the Group of 20 nations were unable to reach full agreement on key climate goals, just 100 days before a critical international conference kicks off. Even after marathon negotiations that ran through the night, the ministers couldn’t find common ground on phasing out coal or how much to limit global warming, Italy’s Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani said at a press conference Friday in Naples. The divisions among the G-20 nations bode badly for United Nations climate talks set to start Oct. 31 in Glasgow. Leaders and diplomats including U.S. presidential climate envoy John Kerry have repeatedly stressed that the meeting, known as COP 26, may be the last chance to set international policies that would prevent the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is key to staving off the worst impacts of climate change. “The G-20 accounts for 80% of all global emissions,” said Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN’s climate change secretariat. “There is no path to 1.5C without the G-20.” G-20 Set for Weak Climate Pledges in One More Setback Ending the use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, was a major sticking point. Italy, which is hosting the G-20 meeting, pushed to include that goal within the official communique that will be issued Saturday. However, a number of countries including India and Russia resisted, Cingolani said at the press conference. The U.S., Canada and Europe were pushing for endorsing the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. They met pushback from a group of other countries that was unwilling to go beyond the 2015 Paris Agreement’s less ambitious target of 2 degrees. Cingolani said the nations reached a robust agreement on other fronts despite these areas of divergence, noting that this meeting marked the first time that climate and energy had been dealt with together by the G-20. Areas of disagreement will be addressed in October during the G-20 leaders’ meeting. This year is seen as a crunch time in climate policy, because all 197 countries in the Paris accord must submit enhanced national plans for cutting emissions. So far only 97 have done so, Espinosa said. That includes Indonesia, the world’s eighth-largest source of carbon emissions, which submitted a new national plan during the meeting. However, it had the same top-line emissions targets submitted five years ago. Its longer-term goals show that the country plans to peak emissions in 2030 and could reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2060 or sooner. “Indonesia should step up its efforts to address the climate crisis,” Tjokorda Nirarta Samadhi, director of the World Resources Institute’s Indonesia office, said by email. The country should “commit to stop investing in new coal plants and reach zero deforestation by 2030, coupled with substantial reforestation.”

Honeywell International Inc.’s profit topped analyst estimates as the company’s aerospace and energy businesses started to recover from the pandemic-induced slump, adding to robust growth from factory-automation and building-safety products. The company raised its profit and sales outlook. Adjusted second-quarter earnings rose to $2.02 a share, soaring from $1.26 last year when airlines slashed services and oil prices dropped as people stopped traveling to stem the spread of Covid-19. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.94, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales jumped 18% to $8.81 billion, while Wall Street projected $8.65 billion.

The customary summer slowdown couldn’t come sooner for the participants in Europe’s debt market after an intense 18 months of deals and travel bans kept them tied to their desks. Junk debt sales for the year to date are already close to surpassing 2020’s record amount -- and the deals keep on coming. Investment grade issuance has slowed from the ferocious levels of debt-raising when the pandemic first struck, but activity throughout 2021 remained brisk right up until this week. September is looking no less busy.

The chief executive of Danske Bank A/S said the lender still faces a number of hurdles, including a sluggish retail business, raising questions about management’s ability to live up to long-term profitability targets. Carsten Egeriis, who became CEO in April after his predecessor stepped down due to a money laundering probe, said Danske is still suffering from “reputational issues,” which are weighing on retail customer sentiment. On a conference call that followed quarterly results containing few surprises, Egeriis also signaled that any payout of excess capital would probably have to wait until after Danske knows the full cost of its Estonian dirty-money scandal.

Budapest, Hungary (AP) -- A new study suggests that a Sinopharm vaccine offers poor protection from COVID-19 among the elderly, raising questions for dozens of countries that have given the Chinese company’s shots to their most vulnerable populations. A survey of blood samples taken from 450 people in Hungary at least two weeks after their second Sinopharm dose found that 90% under 50 years old developed protective antibodies. But the percentage declined with age, and 50% of those over 80 had none.

The IHS Markit flash index of purchasing managers in the service sector slipped to 59.8 from 64.6 a month earlier, the group reported Friday. While the gauge has softened since soaring to a record in May, it remains historically elevated. Readings above 50 indicate growth.

Purdue Pharma LP and its owners, members of the billionaire Sackler family, are betting big on a controversial area of bankruptcy law. The OxyContin maker has for nearly two years been working toward federal court approval of its landmark opioid settlement, which would hand all of its assets -- along with more than $4 billion from its owners -- to cities, states and counties fighting the U.S. opioid crisis. But the plan, which will finally be floated to its bankruptcy judge in the coming weeks, hinges on permanently insulating its owners from opioid lawsuits by way of a divisive legal maneuver.

Happy Friday, Europe. Here’s the latest news and analysis from Bloomberg Economics to take you through to the weekend:

Stocks of Chinese companies tumbled in the U.S., posting the longest losing streak in more than two years, over the risks posed by a potentially widening regulatory crackdown in the nation’s technology industry. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index plunged 8.5%, the steepest drop since March 2020, after officials in Beijing were said to consider forcing companies that offer school tutoring to turn into non-profits. That drove the gauge, which tracks some of China’s biggest firms that are listed in the U.S., to its fourth straight weekly decline, its longest slump since May 2019.

Deutsche Bank AG is accused of turning a blind eye to a years-long Ponzi scheme that involved fraudulent investments in Florida, expanding the growing list of legal and compliance headaches for Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing. Liquidators of two now-bankrupt Cayman Islands investment funds sued the bank in New York and Florida, claiming it “enabled theft on a massive scale” that led to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, court records show. Deutsche Bank maintained accounts for entities involved in the scheme despite repeated red flags and SEC sanctions against them, and it failed to enforce its own rules to prevent money laundering, the suits allege.

Airbnb Inc. and Expedia Group Inc.’s short-term-rental unit Vrbo announced in June that they were partnering to share information about repeat “party house” offenders. What they didn’t agree on was sharing details about properties they’ve banned after violent crimes have occurred there. That became an issue this week after Expedia permanently barred a Mexican villa where a 35-year-old New York City high school teacher was found naked, bruised and near-death three years ago while on a summer vacation. The incident, first reported in a July 20 Bloomberg Businessweek story, led to an immediate lifetime ban of the villa and its host by Airbnb, the platform used to book the stay. But it was only after the story was published that Expedia became aware of what happened and removed the listing from its platform.Unlike hotels, short-term rentals typically have no security guards or on-site support staff. It is up to the hosts who list their homes on the platforms to decide how they want to exchange keys with guests, who has access to the property and whether or not they want to install a smoke detector or put locks on bedroom doors. The lack of regulations has allowed short-term rentals to explode into the fastest-growing sector of the online travel market, collecting almost 30 cents of every dollar spent on hospitality today.

Investors are snapping up German bonds after the ECB tied policy more tightly to its 2% inflation goal, and said it won’t necessarily react immediately if the target is exceeded for a “transitory” period.

Traders holding coffee beans in exchange warehouses are suddenly sitting on a jackpot. That’s because frigid temperatures have wiped out a chunk of the harvest for arabica beans in Brazil, the world’s top grower. So much was lost to frost, in fact, that it’s estimated to equal twice the amount of all arabica beans in warehouses monitored by ICE Futures U.S., the main exchange for trading coffee futures. That’s rapidly driving up the value of the beans -- some of which have been sitting in storage for as long as three years. On Friday, their price hit a six-year high, capping a 17% weekly surge.

Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said the worst of a sales slump has passed and struck a bullish tone about the chipmaker’s prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Investors are waiting to see proof that the company can regain dominance in the semiconductor industry.The key to winning them over will be Gelsinger’s ability to lure back some of the largest companies in technology -- cloud giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google -- whose purchases of server chips for data centers have been a main engine of Intel’s profit and growth. While demand for Intel’s server processors -- its most lucrative business -- picked up in the second quarter from the first, investors fretted that the division’s 9% year-over-year decline in sales may signal a long road to recovery. Intel’s Xeon chips, some of which sell for as much as a compact car, compete for business with souped-up offerings from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and increasingly from the internal chip-design efforts of major cloud customers, who are keen to supply their own parts.Sales to those cloud providers like Amazon’s AWS and Google dropped 20% in the recent period, Intel said on Thursday in its second-quarter earnings report. Gelsinger projected double digit-percentage sales increases for the data center business as a whole in the second half of the year, and said he expects pricing and market share to remain stable. Still, prices dropped in the June quarter because of competitive pressure, and the unit won’t match its revenue total for 2019 this year, he said.

Europe’s southern countries can now claim the brightest collective outlook since the creation of the euro -- once the final hurdles of the coronavirus are overcome -- in a dramatic turnaround after two decades of malaise and crisis. With nearly half of the European Union’s 800 billion-euro ($942 billion) recovery fund flowing their way, officials and business people from Athens to Madrid are gearing up for an unprecedented period of investment that might just succeed in altering their economic destinies. Joblessness among people 15-24 is highest in southern Europe  Source: Eurostat Note: Data for 2020 “If you look at the sums of money that will be invested in countries like Spain, and Greece and Italy, these are extraordinary opportunities to change the path of longer-term growth,” Philipp Hildebrand, vice chair of BlackRock Inc., told Bloomberg Television earlier this month. “That’s the real historic opportunity that Europe now has.” Both during the coronavirus crisis and the sovereign-debt turmoil of the past decade, the region’s southern countries have proven the weakest link in the euro’s delicate structure, endangering the whole project of monetary union. The legacy is daunting. Nine of the region’s top 10 areas for youth unemployment are in southern Europe, ranging as high as 71% in Ceuta, an enclave of Spain. Greece is still scarred from a debt crisis that cost citizens a fifth of disposable income. Then there’s also more recent damage to repair from the pandemic. Spain suffered a contraction of more than a 10th of output in 2020 alone. For Italy, cumulative damage from the coronavirus and years of government deadlock means real gross domestic product is lower than it was when it joined the euro. That danger isn’t yet past, with variants of the virus threatening a new wave of infections over the summer that will hit tourism-dependent nations most. The Greek island of Mykonos is one example, forced by the government to impose a nighttime curfew and a complete ban on music in restaurants, bars and shops. Mykonos Mayor Kostas Koukas has attacked the latest restrictions, but is optimistic about the future. Spending slated for green and energy projects there augur the possibility that many islands can be connected to the mainland’s grid for the first time. “The importance for growth and society of ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply and not being dependent from oil is self-evident,” said Koukas. “Our islands will turn the page.” Greece will receive 30.5 billion euros of EU money, equivalent to almost one-fifth of the economy. Italy will get 192 billion euros in grants and loans, the largest payout of all. Topped up by national spending, around 40% of the money will target its poorer southern regions. Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s administration estimates economic output will increase by 3.6% by 2026. “Europe needs Italy to get back up to speed to succeed, due to the size of its economy, and Italy needs its south to accelerate to succeed,” said Eugenio Mazzarella, a professor at Federico II University in Naples. “It’s all inextricably tied together in a historic wager.” Italian and Greek economies are smaller than when they joined the euro Source: Bloomberg calculations on Eurostat data  Spain will receive around 140 billion euros in funds, around half of which are grants that don’t need to be repaid. With such eyewatering sums in mind, the 23 members of the National Association of Independent Builders are preparing to bid to work on contracts that focus on sustainable transportation, compensating for years of underinvestment. “We need new infrastructure and to maintain existing infrastructure,” said Concha Santos, president of the group. “This package is key to member states’ recovery.” While Moody’s Investors Service warns that Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal will probably struggle to fully disburse EU grants and cheap loans, it reckons public investment in those countries will still double in the next five years compared to the previous half decade. The ratings company projects the EU package will boost economic expansion in southern Europe by around 0.5 percentage points annually on average between 2021 and 2027, a boon that could reach 0.7 percentage points if governments manage to spend it all. The benefit might be even greater if countries deliver on the pledges to achieve sweeping pro-growth and administrative reforms, which are tied to disbursements of the EU funds. They range from fixes to Spain’s troubled labor market to streamlining Italy’s creaking bureaucracy. The danger is that some of the money is wasted -- becoming another squandered moment for a region beset by challenges from huge public debts to poor population growth. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity because of the amounts of money that are concerned, and because it’s an integrated package of not just money but also reforms,” said Sarah Carlson, a Moody’s analyst. “The question that we have is, will they make the most of that?” In any case, even the creation of the recovery fund brings with it hope that one day it might become a permanent cushion against growth shocks, or something even more ambitious. “This could be a first step toward a joint fiscal capacity, and ultimately a fiscal union,” said Alexander Kriwoluzky, an economist at think tank DIW Berlin. “That could be a game changer for future generations.” — With assistance by Giovanni Salzano, and Catherine Bosley

That danger isn’t yet past, with variants of the virus threatening a new wave of infections over the summer that will hit tourism-dependent nations most. The Greek island of Mykonos is one example, forced by the government to impose a nighttime curfew and a complete ban on music in restaurants, bars and shops. Mykonos Mayor Kostas Koukas has attacked the latest restrictions, but is optimistic about the future. Spending slated for green and energy projects there augur the possibility that many islands can be connected to the mainland’s grid for the first time. “The importance for growth and society of ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply and not being dependent from oil is self-evident,” said Koukas. “Our islands will turn the page.” Greece will receive 30.5 billion euros of EU money, equivalent to almost one-fifth of the economy. Italy will get 192 billion euros in grants and loans, the largest payout of all. Topped up by national spending, around 40% of the money will target its poorer southern regions. Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s administration estimates economic output will increase by 3.6% by 2026. “Europe needs Italy to get back up to speed to succeed, due to the size of its economy, and Italy needs its south to accelerate to succeed,” said Eugenio Mazzarella, a professor at Federico II University in Naples. “It’s all inextricably tied together in a historic wager.” Italian and Greek economies are smaller than when they joined the euro Source: Bloomberg calculations on Eurostat data  Spain will receive around 140 billion euros in funds, around half of which are grants that don’t need to be repaid. With such eyewatering sums in mind, the 23 members of the National Association of Independent Builders are preparing to bid to work on contracts that focus on sustainable transportation, compensating for years of underinvestment. “We need new infrastructure and to maintain existing infrastructure,” said Concha Santos, president of the group. “This package is key to member states’ recovery.” While Moody’s Investors Service warns that Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal will probably struggle to fully disburse EU grants and cheap loans, it reckons public investment in those countries will still double in the next five years compared to the previous half decade. The ratings company projects the EU package will boost economic expansion in southern Europe by around 0.5 percentage points annually on average between 2021 and 2027, a boon that could reach 0.7 percentage points if governments manage to spend it all. The benefit might be even greater if countries deliver on the pledges to achieve sweeping pro-growth and administrative reforms, which are tied to disbursements of the EU funds. They range from fixes to Spain’s troubled labor market to streamlining Italy’s creaking bureaucracy. The danger is that some of the money is wasted -- becoming another squandered moment for a region beset by challenges from huge public debts to poor population growth. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity because of the amounts of money that are concerned, and because it’s an integrated package of not just money but also reforms,” said Sarah Carlson, a Moody’s analyst. “The question that we have is, will they make the most of that?” In any case, even the creation of the recovery fund brings with it hope that one day it might become a permanent cushion against growth shocks, or something even more ambitious. “This could be a first step toward a joint fiscal capacity, and ultimately a fiscal union,” said Alexander Kriwoluzky, an economist at think tank DIW Berlin. “That could be a game changer for future generations.” — With assistance by Giovanni Salzano, and Catherine Bosley

Tencent Holdings Ltd. was ordered to give up exclusive music streaming rights and pay half a million yuan in fines, becoming the latest Chinese internet giant to be brought to heel by regulators. An official investigation found Tencent’s 2016 acquisition of China Music Corp.’s stakes violated regulations partly because of a lack of reporting to authorities, according to a statement by the anti-trust watchdog on Saturday. The State Administration for Market Regulation required Tencent and its affiliates to waive exclusive music rights within 30 days and handed down a fine of 500,000 yuan ($77,145).

South Korea passed its second-largest extra budget of the pandemic, seeking to shore up the economy as the country’s worst virus wave so far shows little sign of abating. The 34.9 trillion won ($30.3 billion) spending plan approved by lawmakers early Saturday is slightly larger than the original proposal submitted by the government. The budget includes a 250,000 won cash handout that covers most people in the country and will prove a timely bulwark against the economic damage from a semi-lockdown affecting half the population.

Europe’s southern countries can now claim the brightest collective outlook since the creation of the euro -- once the final hurdles of the coronavirus are overcome -- in a dramatic turnaround after two decades of malaise and crisis. With nearly half of the European Union’s 800 billion-euro ($942 billion) recovery fund flowing their way, officials and business people from Athens to Madrid are gearing up for an unprecedented period of investment that might just succeed in altering their economic destinies. Joblessness among people 15-24 is highest in southern Europe  Source: Eurostat Note: Data for 2020 “If you look at the sums of money that will be invested in countries like Spain, and Greece and Italy, these are extraordinary opportunities to change the path of longer-term growth,” Philipp Hildebrand, vice chair of BlackRock Inc., told Bloomberg Television earlier this month. “That’s the real historic opportunity that Europe now has.” Both during the coronavirus crisis and the sovereign-debt turmoil of the past decade, the region’s southern countries have proven the weakest link in the euro’s delicate structure, endangering the whole project of monetary union. The legacy is daunting. Nine of the region’s top 10 areas for youth unemployment are in southern Europe, ranging as high as 71% in Ceuta, an enclave of Spain. Greece is still scarred from a debt crisis that cost citizens a fifth of disposable income. Then there’s also more recent damage to repair from the pandemic.

The U.S. Justice Department has decided not to investigate New York State’s handling of the coronavirus in its nursing homes, the department said in a letter on Friday to a Republican opponent of Governor Andrew Cuomo. Deputy Assistant General Joe Gaeta wrote to Representative Lee Zeldin that the department’s Civil Rights Division had asked for information from the Cuomo administration last August “regarding Covid-19 and nursing facilities run by, or for, the State of New York.”

Politicians and scientists in the U.K. are concerned that people are deleting the official Covid-19 mobile phone app, or at least switching off its tracing function, to avoid having to self-isolate. Just under 620,000 people in England and Wales were “pinged” by the National Health Service Covid-19 app and told to isolate in the past week -- a record, and up from around 530,000 the week before, official figures show.

Citigroup co-Chief Executive John S. Reed's retirement in mid-April will leave Sanford I. Weill, 66, sole ruler of a $170 billion empire stretching over 100 countries. Many analysts are guessing that Weill, free from Reed's characteristically cautious approach to mergers, will switch to what he does best--buying up companies and squeezing out costs, especially in the U.S., where financial services firms are cheap. Citigroup, says Raymond James & Associates banking analyst Richard X. Bove, will become "maniacally aggressive." Not so fast, says Weill. Although he concedes that there are financial services firms that could be considered bargains in the U.S., "it's a little too early to tell" whether or not any of them will work with Citi's strategy. "We have to see what can be done with a branch," Weill says, adding that he's not convinced that Citi needs to expand its physical presence.

Intel Chief Executive Craig R. Barrett sounds nearly poetic when he describes why it has been so darn hard getting the giant chipmaker to charge into new businesses--and into the Internet Age, where the old rules of computerdom no longer hold. Not surprisingly, Barrett conjures up a Western metaphor. He does, after all, live in Arizona, commuting most weeks to Intel Corp.'s Silicon Valley headquarters. Barrett compares Intel's microprocessor business to the creosote bush, a tall desert plant that drips poisonous oil, killing off all vegetation that tries to grow anywhere near it. Microprocessors so dominated the company's strategy, he says, that other businesses could not sprout around it. Chips, he says, "are a dream business, with wonderful margins and a wonderful market position. How could anything else compete here for resources and profitability?" How, indeed, unless you have a CEO who is kicking up a sandstorm to find a way. Nearly two years after Barrett took the reins at Intel, the chip giant is in the midst of a historic overhaul that is transforming its business and its culture--for a second time. The first, back in 1985, Intel fled the memory chip business and bet the farm on microprocessors, turning itself from a diversified maker of chips into one focused solely on producing the electronic brains of personal computers. It was a brilliant move that set up the company for a golden period of growth under legendary CEO Andrew S. Grove. But now, the days of Intel concentrating virtually all its energy and investment on PC chips are gone.

Tuesday, Mar. 7, 8:30 a.m.EST -- Output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector probably grew at an annual rate of 6%, says the median forecast of economists surveyed by Standard & Poor's MMS, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies. That leap in the rate, which would be the biggest productivity advance in seven years, is suggested by the upward revision to the fourth quarter's real gross domestic product. The Commerce Dept. now says real GDP grew at a 6.9% annual rate, up from the initially reported 5.8% pace. The upward revision to productivity means that unit labor costs probably fell at a rate greater than 2%, more than the 1.1% first reported. The new forecast for productivity would mean that output per work hour rose by about 3.6% for all of 1999, the largest gain since 1992. Tuesday, Mar. 7, 3 p.m. EST -- Consumers probably added $7.5 billion in new debt in January, says the S&P MMS forecast. That's slightly below the $8.2 billion averaged monthly in 1999, but at yearend, borrowing surged. New debt jumped by $15.8 billion in November and $11.2 billion in December. Strong consumer finances are making households feel very comfortable about taking on large quantities of debt. That's the reason credit outstanding at the end of 1999 equalled a record 20.6% of disposable income.

The big job for J. Smoke Wallin last year was to get his family's liquor-distribution business, Indianapolis-based National Wine & Spirits Inc., on to the Internet. But Wallin, 33, discovered a raft of online upstarts was setting up much broader sites that could slice off big chunks of the alcoholic-beverage industry--leaving distributors such as National in the lurch. So instead, he formed eSkye.com Inc., a national marketplace for beverage makers, distributors, and retailers to buy and sell online. Spits Wallin: "I don't want some kid out of Silicon Valley with a nose ring to come in and take over my business." Neither do thousands of other traditional companies under fire from cheeky dot-coms. By forming electronic marketplaces or exchanges on the Web, hundreds of upstart online sites are scrambling to make themselves the new commercial hubs of industries from aerospace to waste management. Operating as middlemen between suppliers and their customers, they charge a small percentage of each transaction. Now, like Wallin, the incumbents are firing back and staking their claims on the Net. And they're doing so with a haste that wows even dot-com rivals.

Lisa Bevill took on the role of director of international admissions at IE Business School in Madrid (previously known as Instituto de Empresa) earlier this year. A graduate of the international MBA program at IE, she also has professional experience in the U.S., Germany, and Spain. Within the past three years, applications to IE have increased more than 20%, Bevill says. During the last application cycle, 30% of the applicants were accepted into the international MBA program. This year, around 300 students—more than 90% of them from outside Spain—will be enrolling in the international MBA program. For the first time, demand to attend is so great that a second group of students will begin classes next April.

On Sept. 7, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said it affirmed its long-term AAA and short-term A-1+ senior unsecured debt ratings on Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE). The outlook is stable. At the same time, S&P lowered its "risk-to-the-government standalone issuer" credit ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to R (regulatory supervision) from A- and withdrew the ratings. It also revised the CreditWatch listing of the BBB+ subordinated debt ratings on these entities to positive from negative. In addition, it lowered the preferred stock ratings to C from BBB- and removed the ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. The subordinated debt and preferred stock ratings were originally placed on CreditWatch on Aug. 26, 2008.

In a recent TV ad for Black Cloud ammunition, a frantic flock of ducks darts around an orange sky as a heavy-metal guitar riff chugs ominously in the background. Cut to black. A slogan pops up, each word punctuated with a shotgun blast: Drop. Ducks. Like. Rain. The spots, currently airing on Versus cable network, are remarkably brash for the otherwise moribund ammunition market. The goal for Black Cloud's maker, the $4.6 billion defense contractor Alliant Techsystems (ATK), is to coax more dollars out of the shrinking ranks of hunters using brightly colored boxes, loud ads, and promises of premium-grade ammo made better by "lethal science." What ATK is trying to sell is, in short, a deadlier shot. "A lot of people look at ammo as a commodity," says Mark DeYoung, president of ATK's Armament Systems. "We've really gone to high-performance projectiles." That mindset helps explain why Minneapolis-based ATK has become the country's largest ammo manufacturer less than a decade after entering the market. The maker of space rockets, TNT, and warheads pushed its way into small-caliber ammunition in 2000 with an aggressive bid to run the U.S. Army's Lake City Ammunition Plant in Independence, Mo., that made it the military's biggest ammo supplier. It has since moved swiftly into the civilian sphere, wooing hunters and police officers with creative marketing and bold promises of better performance. Military sales make up almost 70% of revenues for ATK's $1.6 billion Armament Systems Div., one of ATK's fastest-ýgrowing units. On Aug. 7 the unit reported a 32% increase in sales for the last quarter, to $442 million, while profits jumped 53%, to $44 million. The push into premium-priced ammo comes at a key moment. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have sent demand skyrocketing. Lake City now pumps out 1.4 billion rounds a year—a level not seen since the Vietnam War—helping ATK shares to double in five years, to around 106. But a drop in troop levels could halt ATK's big run: "The perception is that they are very tied to Iraq," says UBS (UBS) analyst David Strauss. Getting higher profits from the consumer segment could be tough. A round of ammo, or a cartridge, is generally made up of a brass casing packed with a primer, gunpowder, and a bullet. The raw materials used to make those components—especially copper and lead—have risen dramatically in cost over the past few years, forcing all ammo makers to raise prices. While the hunting market may be shrinking, those who have stuck with it spend an average of $1,829 a year on their hobby. Dolph Varner of Columbia, S.C., lays out at least that much making hunting trips to Nebraska, Louisiana, and Canada. Varner buys Federal Premium ammunition, ATK's top-of-the-line brand, which can cost up to $70 for a box of 20. (ATK's Federal Cape Shock brand, for big-game animals, can cost more than $200 a box.) "Serious sportsmen do not tolerate people who cannot make a clean kill," says Varner. That's the kind of attitude ATK likes to play off in its advertising. While companies such as Remington and Winchester Ammunition still sell their wares in bland boxes, ATK is all about buzz. Federal Premium boxes show pictures of the type of animal each round is designed to kill, from squirrels to mule deer. The box for ATK's Fusion brand is bright orange with flames encircling the brand name. Black Cloud shotgun shells claim to "wreak havoc on impact." They're endorsed by TV duck hunter Phil "the Duck Commander" Robertson, who can be seen in a Black Cloud spot knee-deep in a swamp covered in grime, grimacing menacingly as he clutches his shotgun. Laggards just a few years ago, the ATK brands together now outsell all other commercial ammo brands, besting Winchester and Remington. "They are great marketers," says Gary Buescher, vice-president for hunting and firearms at outdoor retail chain Gander Mountain (GMTN), which has kiosks at some of its 113 stores showing loops of Federal ammo being used to take down wildebeests in Africa and other animals. ATK also has in-store charts to show how much weight its bullets retain upon impact (the less it breaks apart, the more deadly it is). ATK's biggest source of demand remains the military. Production of .50-caliber rounds has increased twelvefold since the U.S. invaded Iraq in early 2003. Often fitted with explosive-tipped bullets, the rounds are usually fed into heavy machine guns mounted on Humvees. One .50-caliber shot can pierce an armored vehicle and blow it up. "The guys in Iraq just love them," says a former U.S. Marine who works at Lake City. As for the election, ATK Chief Executive Daniel Murphy claims he's "not at all concerned" with a party shift—though he expects a "change of priorities." Along with hawking upscale bullets to hunters, ATK has rolled out accessories including rifle scopes, clothing, and gun bags to help offset any decline in military sales.

In the time of coronavirus, to log in to Twitter or Facebook is to be bombarded with posts about infection rates, hand sanitizer and social distancing. Airlines are dropping flights, countries are tightening borders, and concerts and conferences have been canceled. But there’s one place where it’s possible to escape the outbreak: Instagram. On Instagram, the Facebook Inc.-owned photo-sharing app, many high-profile users still seem to be on vacation. Travel influencers -- the app’s famous authorities on the most ’grammable sunsets and resorts -- are continuing their posts unabated. “We see it as our role to help support tourism during these tough times,” said Kate Torpy and Olly Neville, the couple behind @KOTravellers. Their most recent dispatches, posted to their 342,000 followers, showcase idyllic weather and suntans in Fiji, the Maldives and Japan. None mentions the virus, or the havoc it’s wreaking on international travel and commerce.

Medical historian Howard Markel remembers attending New York City’s St. Patrick’s Day parade back in 2000. As marching bands, dancers, and floats came down Fifth Avenue, sidewalks on either side were jam-packed with spectators. “There was also a great deal of drinking going on that begins hours before the parade,” he says. “And drunk people don’t make good decisions.” He left soon thereafter. The health risks posed by the annual event, which typically draws some 2 million visitors and 150,000 marchers to Manhattan, became the focus of New York City’s coronavirus outbreak response this week, with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio insisting until Wedenesday that the iconic parade would go on, even as scores of other cities — including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago and even Dublin — canceled their St. Patrick’s Day observances. Finally, shortly before midnight on Wednesday, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that, for the first time in more than 250 years, the parade would be postponed. Confirmed cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have surpassed 1,300 in the U.S. as of March 12, but with delays in testing, actual figures are likely far larger. Health experts are stepping up their message urging strict social-distancing measures: quarantines for people who may have been exposed to the virus, closing schools, promoting telework, and banning or discouraging public gatherings. New York’s insistence that its St. Patrick’s Day festivities would proceed stood out as an increasingly awkward exception to this lockdown approach, thanks not only to its size (it’s the largest St. Pat’s parade in the world) but its alcohol-fueled rowdiness. As in other places that host these citywide frat parties, the event is something of an epidemiologist’s nightmare: Packed sidewalks along the route mean it’s not uncommon for families admiring leprechaun-themed floats to stand inches away from attendees puking up the contents of their morning pub crawl. (Since New York’s bars are still open, those pub crawls will continue this weekend, according to PubCrawl.com, which organizes bar-hopping excursions in several U.S. cities.) Even without the booze, though, parades are especially concerning to health experts, as the coronavirus appears to spread easily when groups are in close quarters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people maintain “social distance” (described as being at least six feet away from another person). The size and scope of the gathering matter little to Markel, who teaches the history of medicine at the University of Michigan. “Big parades, small parades, organized parades, disorganized parades — being in a crowd right now, particularly if you are in a high-risk group, is just not advisable,” he says. What matters more is “who is in the mix, and who you are standing next to.” The lethality of combining of parades and pandemics was made tragically evident a hundred years ago. On September 28, 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, some 200,000 people flooded the streets of Philadelphia for a patriotic parade intended to raise $259 million in government bonds to help fund America’s war effort. But the U.S. had just experienced the first wave of a deadly influenza outbreak that had been sweeping the globe, and was at the beginning of a second wave. Some 600 sailors in Philadelphia were infected just days earlier, likely having contracted the disease from returning troops. In the 24 hours leading up to the parade, 118 new cases were detected, according to a local newspaper report that didn’t run until later that afternoon, according to the Philly Voice.  Anxiety over what became known as the Spanish flu had yet to hit the public, and the city — ignoring warnings from physicians — went ahead with the parade. A week later, 2,600 were dead from the flu, and the number of cases rose to 4,500 the week after. Officials later closed schools, churches, theaters, and other public gathering places, but much of the damage had already been done. More than 12,000 city residents would die in the next weeks, though Markel says the deaths can’t be entirely pinned on the parade itself. Philadelphia, like several other cities at the time, took several missteps, including trying to prevent panic early in the epidemic by downplaying its threat and assuring the public that the flu wouldn’t spread beyond military camps. When the virus rapidly spread, the city was unprepared. There weren’t enough beds among the city’s 31 hospitals, medical staff were overworked and catching the flu themselves, and it wasn’t until October 2 that the mayor committed $100,000 in emergency funding.Other cities managed to limit mortality by taking more proactive social-distancing measures: In St. Louis, for example, city leaders closed schools, churches and theaters and banned gatherings of more than 20 people. “St. Louis did everything early and layered more than one intervention option, and for a long time,” Markel says. “And they had a wonderful health commissioner, Max Starkloff, who knew how to deal with the people, with the mayor, with the newspaper, and the school boards. It was that rare leadership that’s really important.” That leadership paid off, as St. Louis experienced one of the lowest mortality rates among large U.S. cities. “Of the 31,500 who got sick in St. Louis,” KMOV4 reports, “only 1,703 died.” While the coronavirus outbreak differs from the 1918 flu pandemic in several ways — from the viruses themselves to the advancement of medical technology — the threat posed by public gatherings remains. Witness the two-day biotech leadership conference that became the epicenter of a Covid-19 outbreak in Boston, responsible for at least 70 of 92 infections in Massachusetts as of Tuesday and many more in other states. “The virus raced through this two-day conference at a frightening speed that state health officials and company executives were unable to match,” the Boston Globe writes.  4.

So far, the ever-louder call to cancel everything has halted everything from festivals like South by Southwest and Coachella to Seattle’s public schools to the NBA season. In Washington state, Governor Jay Inslee also took extra measures to ban all large public gatherings in its largest metropolitan area, while King County officials are going even further and prohibiting events smaller than 250 people that don’t meet public health requirements like the CDC’s six-foot rule. Many more marquee public events are coming up as spring approaches in the U.S., like Washington, D.C.’s famous Cherry Blossom Parade. Markel says that while they don’t all have to be called off right now, city officials should prepare to heed the lessons of past outbreaks. “It’s not an issue about preventing the spread — it never was,” he says. “It’s an issue of minimizing the number of patients. So why would do anything to increase your chance of a case?”

The pyramids of Egypt have been on Genelle Edwards’s travel bucket list for years. She started having second thoughts about her two-week trip to Egypt, due to start on March 16, after an outbreak of the new coronavirus on a  cruise ship on the Nile River and the death of a German tourist from Covid-19 at a hospital in a Red Sea resort. “I’m worried about being quarantined and stuck when I’m there,” says the 68-year-old retired business owner from Austin. “But also I’m concerned with my age, as I’m almost at the highest-risk category.” Edwards says she now plans to cancel, a decision that could be costly: She spent $8,500 plus rewards points on the trip and may only be able to rebook the flight. The conundrum—to travel or not—is a common one, as the coronavirus spreads globally: Those with existing reservations face potentially steep losses for canceling, while those contemplating trips must weigh the risk of getting sick or being quarantined against the discount offers from airlines, tour operators, and cruise companies coping with plummeting sales. While trip insurance doesn’t typically cover disruption tied to epidemics or fear of travel, some coronavirus claims are nonetheless being accommodated: German insurer Allianz SE has started covering medical treatment and trip cancellation and interruption for customers who become ill with Covid-19 or who are scheduled to visit regions with major outbreaks, under certain circumstances and for those with applicable benefits. Tourism in Italy has practically ground to a halt after the country issued a  nationwide lockdown on March 9. President Donald Trump’s decision to  restrict travel from Europe to the U.S. starting March 13 adds another layer of complexity for the industry and individuals. For destinations with just a few cases, travelers who cancel can generally expect to lose at least part of the money. TUI AG, a tour operator based in Hanover, Germany, reimburses excursions affected by government-issued travel warnings, but not those canceled because customers are simply wary of traveling. “Fear of infection is not a reason to withdraw from a trip,” says Susanne Stuenckel, a spokeswoman for TUI.  Data: Hayley Berg, economist at Hopper What a typical leisure traveler should expect to pay, based on consumer airfare searches.  The travel industry is starting to loosen some conditions to encourage people to take advantage of deals. German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which is cutting as many as half of its flights because of the virus, has waived rebooking fees through April. Melia Hotels & Resorts of Spain is offering rebates of up to 45% and free cancellations. “Many hotels are trying to be more flexible, because they want the travelers to come, if not next week, maybe in three months,” says Alexis Waravka, public affairs manager of Hotrec, an association of hotels, restaurants, pubs, and cafes in Europe. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is offering guests full credit on their fare even if they opt out as late as 48 hours before embarkation on trips before the end of July. After that, the policy returns to the stricter charges that usually apply for the industry: They’d have to cancel at least 57 days before sailing to get everything but their deposit back. The looser terms may not be enough to offset declining business for cruise operators. Travelers on several ships have been quarantined for days to weeks after confirmed cases of Covid-19 or because of fears of possible infections, highlighting a risk for the global industry’s more than 300 vessels. Most notable was  Princess Cruises Inc.’s Diamond Princess, which saw about 700 people become infected and was forced to dock for weeks off the coast of Japan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended travelers defer all cruise ship travel worldwide because of a higher risk of person-to-person spread. HolidayPirates Group, which runs travel deal websites in 10 countries, is trying to quell some of the traveler concerns by promoting information on safe destinations, cancellation policies and insurance, and tips on staying healthy. The Berlin-based company, which saw sales slump 30% from late February to early March because of virus-related fears, is expecting the campaign and low-cost deals to bring some business back. “The longer the situation takes, the more travelers will get used to it and the less panic there’ll be,” says Chief Executive Officer David Armstrong. Claire Fletcher, 33, a marketing manager in Durham, N.C., took advantage of a cheap offer in January when she booked a round-trip flight for $349 to San Francisco. The trip to see the city and the redwood forests with two friends in early May is on for now, but Fletcher says she’d be deterred by a large outbreak like the one in Italy or even one that spreads city-wide. She expects she’d be reimbursed for accommodation and car rental if she is forced to cancel the trip. “I’m pregnant and have asthma, so I need to be cautious as even the regular flu could be dangerous,” she says.

In the past two days alone, two African-American NBA basketball players have tested positive for coronavirus, and several cases have turned up among native populations in both African and Caribbean countries, puncturing any theory that black people are immune to the disease. Yet the memes persist.  So NONE of these Corona Virus cases have been black people?! LEMME FOUND OUT WE IMMUNE. It’s the least God can do after slavery. Statements like this one are surely made in jest. But there are at least some instances of actual scientific or medical arguments, which outlets including Reuters and Politifact have already debunked. While some may argue that the jokes, at least, are harmless, U.S. history evinces how unsubstantiated claims about race-based resilience to disease have led to devastating outcomes, particularly for African Americans. The impacts of such beliefs still affect how people of color are medically treated — or not — today.  I’ve heard a few people claim that black people are somehow immune to #coronavirus. I haven’t seen any scientific evidence of that. Don’t be careless pic.twitter.com/Z9mNKDWPoG The 18th-century yellow fever outbreak in the Americas is instructive here. In the 1740s, yellow fever had overtaken coastal port cities such as Charleston, South Carolina, driving people into delirium, endless vomiting, hemorrhaging, and eventually death. The physician John Lining recorded his observations about the disease in Charleston after inspecting slave ships and their cargo —including captive Africans — finding that it was almost exclusively white people who were succumbing to the disease. These observations helped reinforce already-stirring beliefs that Africans had some kind of supernatural inoculation to some of the deadliest diseases floating along the American coast. Lining’s medical briefs became the reference manuals for another physician, Dr. Benjamin Rush, when in 1793 a yellow fever outbreak took hold of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which at the time was the nation’s capitol. Close to 20,000 people — half of the population — fled Philly that year, while many African Americans actually stayed in the city at the request of Rush, who wanted to train them to nurse, care-take, and dig graves for the thousands of people dying of yellow fever. Rush was operating on the belief that black people were immune to the disease, and black Philadelphians believed him when he told them that they were. Rush not only was an outspoken abolitionist, but also friend of the black clergymen Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, founders of the African Methodist Episcopal church, and two of the most influential African Americans of the time. Jones and Allen helped convince black people to stay behind to assist Rush, telling their congregations that it was their Christian duty to help care for the lives of white Philadelphians. But Rush was wrong. Many of the African Americans in his medical camp contracted the disease. Hundreds of them died. Allen became afflicted and almost died himself. While Rush was a highly respected doctor — the American Psychiatric Association would later title him the “father of American psychiatry” — he was relying on faulty claims about race and health conditions that proved fatally wrong. The Philadelphia massacre became an abject lesson in what happens when race gets bandied about amidst the rages of a major health maelstrom. As Dr. Rana Hogarth wrote in her book Medicalizing Blackness about the 1793 yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia: “The idea of innate black immunity placed an undue burden on the city’s black inhabitants. For those black people who did stay behind to help, it meant buying into a belief that at its core defined their bodies as being distinctive and unequal to whites.” This is why Hogarth bristles a little every time she sees memes fly by on Twitter or Facebook pointing out fewer documented cases of coronavirus in Africa, or fewer deaths of African Americans, as indications that black people are somehow impervious to the disease. Such statements, whether made literally or comically, are rooted in racist beliefs that hearken back to the 18th century yellow fever disaster that almost decimated black Philadelphia. “I can understand the idea of saying black people as a group have suffered so much, particularly if we look at medical history, that we're going to flip the script,” said Hogarth. “But let's just pump the brakes on this because there were very real moments in history where African Americans were believed to be immune or were peculiar in some way, and it wasn't seen as a bonus. It was actually seen as, ‘OK, now you have to stay behind and put your lives at risk because we just assume you won't get this,’ and that's the part where I kind of pause and say, OK, this is not good.” Medical theories about black immunity persisted after the Philadelphia yellow fever outbreak, refortifying political and economic justifications for keeping Africans enslaved. The thought was that black people are best suited for chattel labor because of their ability to fight off attacks on their health, even though the Philadelphia case disproved that. Some medical authorities attempted seemingly savvier takes on black immunity, adding that this superpower was linked not just to race, but to proximity to certain geographic locations and climates, mainly in the tropics. Those takes ended up as part of the Confederate South’s arguments for preserving its plantation and slave-based economy. The climate-based argument was that certain deadly diseases couldn’t survive in warmer temperatures, which happens to be the same argument that a cruise ship line made recently about coronavirus, to convince people to keep booking trips with them. As the Miami New Times reported on March 10, Norwegian Cruises ordered sales workers to give customers scripted lines such as: “The coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise," and, "Scientists and medical professionals have confirmed that the warm weather of the spring will be the end of the coronavirus.” There is no scientific evidence that coronavirus is vulnerable at any temperature, just like the claims of earlier centuries that diseases like yellow fever can’t survive in tropical conditions or in tropical people were either overblown or flat-out false. The only thing that inoculated a person from yellow fever back then, says Hogarth, was actually contracting the disease and being lucky enough to survive. Since yellow fever originated in mosquitos native to West Africa, the black-immunity truthers of the time didn’t take into account how many Africans may have died from the disease in their native lands. Today, almost all cases of yellow fever (90%) occur in the tropical areas of Africa and South America. Beyond climate and geography, ideas about race and health powers continued to flourish throughout the 18th century among white medical professionals, taking as gospel declarations that black skin was thicker than white skin, which emboldened doctors to experiment on black bodies. One major medical idea percolating back then was that black people feel less pain and suffering than other races — an idea that became the underpinning for the surgical experimentations that Dr. James Marion Sims performed on black women in his quest to perfect procedures for fixing incontinence and reproductive problems. Today he is considered the “father of gynecology,” though monuments of his likeness have recently been taken down in recent years. For Hogarth, the way race was treated in health matters back then informs how we talk about both today, and not often in ways that illuminate the actual impacts of particular diseases on black people. “So for example, you know when people say, ‘Oh the black women's maternal mortality rate is appalling — a much higher rate than for whites,’? It's good that we recognize that, but can we not make it about there being something wrong with black women?” said Hogarth. “Can we say that maybe black women are more likely to be discriminated against, to not be taken seriously, to have their complaints ignored than white women?” Race, or rather racism, and health have also spelled doom for Chinese Americans. Unlike black people, they have not been deemed uniquely indestructible, but rather uniquely susceptible and contagious when it comes to disease. In the early 1900s, Chinatown was burned down in Honolulu out of a belief that the neighborhood was spreading the disease. Conservatives (and USA Today) have been eager to label coronavirus the “Wuhan virus” or the “China virus,” further stigmatizing this ethnic population. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Chinese residents and students were getting racially harassed in the city well before the first case even turned up there. “Personally I find the xenophobia and anti-Asian responses very troubling because the quick move from epidemic control to racist or otherwise discriminatory practices of public health has a long history and we seem to be on the precipice of writing a new chapter in that history,” said Alexandre White, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University also affiliated with the university’s department of the history of medicine. “That should be a concern not just for people of Asian descent, but any group that has been marginalized or oppressed for any reason. We can today see a lot of commonalities around racist discourse around Covid-19 and broader ideologies of racism throughout history.” Much of that racist discourse was incubated during that 18th century medical era response to the yellow fever outbreak. Race was used to formulate policies around who should and shouldn’t be exposed to a deadly disease, and then race was weaponized in the disease’s aftermath to determine who was responsible for it.   “In Philadelphia, [they] did what [they were] supposed to do, and look at what they get in return,” said Hogarth. “Their work is part of this long history of exasperation among African Americans who are saying that we are tired of trying to be part of this society even when we are excluded deliberately, and what we get is a minimizing of our suffering, and then blamed when things don’t go well.” It’s clearly not a laughing matter.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump haven’t spoken in months, but the California Democrat seized the initiative to strike a deal with the White House on a broad measure aimed at helping Americans cope with the spiraling effects of the coronavirus outbreak.

Global central banks already struggling to spur inflation amid the spreading coronavirus are facing a fresh challenge -- the oil crash. The price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has given crude its worst week since 2008 will put heavy downward pressure on inflation just as the coronavirus outbreak hits consumer spending. It’s undoing the years of effort that monetary authorities have put in, along with trillions of dollars of stimulus, trying to hit their price-stability targets.

Global central banks stepped up their crisis-fighting this week in a campaign to keep markets functioning and economies growing as the coronavirus looks increasingly likely to tip the world into its first recession since the financial crisis.Among the tools deployed: Interest-rate cuts, asset purchases, currency interventions and liquidity injections. Markets reacted just as aggressively. Trading volatility spiked to levels not seen since the financial crisis as the S&P 500 Index’s historic bull run came to an end and signs of illiquidity emerged across debt markets. Even the $17 trillion U.S. government-bond market wasn’t immune, with the gap between prices bid and sellers’ offers widening sharply. Meanwhile, the dollar staged its biggest jump in 12 years, climbing to a three-year high, as investors piled into haven assets.With more action likely next week, here’s a rundown of what happened this week:

Christine Lagarde’s verbal faux pas on Thursday puts the European Central Bank chief in a distinguished club of global monetary officials whose words have inadvertently roiled financial markets. The president’s comment that it’s not her institution’s job to close bond spreads seemed to undermine previous pledges to defend the integrity of the euro area, and sparked a record jump in Italian yields. That remark might yet earn a label as the gravest of such errors, though events surrounding the global panic could equally make it a mere footnote of the current crisis.

Some Americans have found a measure of reassurance in these coronavirus days by stocking up on hand sanitizer and toilet paper. For others, peace comes with the purchase of a $4,995 emergency go-bag, outfitted with “Bond-like gadgets” and custom monogramming. Or a $149.95 “virus-eliminating” personal air purifier that’s worn as a necklace. Or a $99.95 Sanitized Sleeper’s Safe Haven, a bedtime cocoon made from “patented antimicrobial fabric that kills nearly 100% of bacteria, fungi and viruses.” These items are part of a cornucopia of survival products that float at the rarefied end of the burgeoning $4.5 trillion wellness market. As the pandemic spreads, they’re sold out or on back order or otherwise in short supply. Just like toilet paper. “Our warehouse shelves are almost wiped out,” says Ryan Kuhlman, co-founder of Preppi, maker of high-end disaster kits including the go-bag, which comes with four hard-to-obtain N95 respirator masks. Preppi’s sales so far this month have increased 5,000% compared with February. “Having the right tools and supplies can provide incredible relief to anxieties.” Sure, the markets are haywire and every hour or so brings an announcement of another institution closing or public event postponed or canceled. But for makers of products that cater to one-percenters nervous about exposure to a deadly illness, inventory can’t be replenished fast enough. Hammacher Schlemmer’s Sanitized Sleeper’s Safe Haven Source: Hammacher Schlemmer & Co. The granddaddy of pricey-gadget peddlers is Hammacher Schlemmer & Co. The retailer stocks a range of defenses such as the “Virus, Mold, And Germ Destroying Air And Surface Sanitizer,” which for $399.95 promises to zap nasty microbes from your living room using technology similar to what NASA employs to purify its space shuttles. In the days before coronavirus, the item was billed mainly as a mold fighter. And though it was always meant to fight viruses, the company added the v-word to it and some other products to grab the attention of agitated shoppers, not to mention internet-search algorithms. “We strengthened the title to aid consumers in their search,” said Ann Marie Resnick, the company’s vice president of marketing. It’s working. Sales of some Hammacher personal-care items are up as much as 500%, according to Resnick. “It just went boom,” she said. “Everyone needs an air purifier for the home. You’ll need more than one.” Coronavirus-related spending is most prevalent among higher-income consumers, according to Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., and those folks need everyday items as well. Touchland hand sanitizer Source: Touchland If Purell is too gloopy for well-manicured hands, there’s Touchland, a spray-on sanitizer ($12 for 1.3 ounces) whose packaging looks modeled on a mini-iPhone. It contains moisturizers, essential oils and something called Glycereth-26, which the company says is “an awesome humectant.” Bonus: It smells like watermelon or lavender or other fun stuff, not ethyl alcohol. There’s just one problem: It’s currently sold out. “It’s been a little bit crazy,” said Andrea Lisbona, Touchland’s 34-year-old founder and chief executive. Lisbona said she’d just returned to the U.S. from the company’s factory in Mexico, which is ramping up production to get Touchland into the unsanitized hands of the 25,000 customers on its waiting list. “Until three weeks ago, this product was essentially a fashion statement,” said Alexander Chernev, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “Now, things have changed.” Turns out, if you want something that’s both fancy and functional, you might have to wait -- no matter what tax bracket you’re in.

No one is panic-buying motorcycles. Well, probably not. But it’s safe to say there is no longer a bull market for a chrome-covered splurge.  Tomorrow, into the midst of the pandemic, Indian motorcycles will launch one of its most ambitious (and expensive) ad campaigns to date, splashing “mid-seven figures” across a wide range of media, including a national television buy (the NBA and the NHL playoffs were a big part of the package, though the spots will transfer elsewhere). At its heart, the new Indian push is an old-school, Coke-Pepsi taste-test, encouraging motorcyclists to compare its bikes to those of Harley-Davidson. In addition to the ads, Indian, a Polaris brand, has stocked at least one $21,700 Harley at almost all of its 200 North American dealerships for the moto-curious to compare and contrast.  "It's as big of a bet as we've placed previously," Indian marketing chief Reid Wilson told me. Every consumer-facing executive faces a binary market dynamic: either draw new, first-time customers or steal someone else’s—what car and motorcycle makers call “conquesting.” Indian has always been tuned for the latter, since Polaris bought the long-defunct brand and relaunched it in 2014. Its first product wasn’t a small, starter bike aimed at riding rookies, but rather a big, piggy cruiser with a Harley-esque price tag ($19,000). "From a brand standpoint, there’s a definite slice of the pie that wants a different choice,” Wilson says. “They don’t want to be confined to an image that was already there.” In other words, Harley’s outsized lore, its brand swagger, its appropriation as a cultural identity by roughnecks and retired dentists alike, can be a liability as much as an asset. Indian's oppositional stance has worked out nicely. It now reckons that it has rounded up about 10% of the U.S. market for big, cruiser bikes and 20% of the mid-sized bike business. As for the new ad blitz, Indian was working on it long before the world started falling apart, but the timing is propitious. Harley is skidding badly. At the end of January, CEO Matt Levatich stepped down shortly after posting the company’s fifth consecutive year of declining U.S. sales. Harley has made decent headway luring green riders, but it’s having a hard time keeping them on the road. Meanwhile, it’s losing some of its best customers to age and, increasingly, Indian. It’s safe to say the motorcycle market is in for a rough ride as Covid-19 casts a shadow over the busiest time of year for sales and rallies. In the U.S., motorcycling still hasn’t recovered from the last recession. New bike registrations dropped to 253,000 last year, less than half of their 2006 peak. Meanwhile, Harley’s U.S. market share has slipped from 53.3% when Indian revved up in 2014, to 49.1% last year.  It's a scared and scary new world out there and customers will be scarce for awhile. Savvy companies will be working hard to keep the ones they have, while stealing the ones they don't. Self-contain, swipe, repeat.

Following is the FOMC statement released today by the Federal Reserve in Washington: The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States. Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected. Available economic data show that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remained strong through February and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending rose at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remained weak. More recently, the energy sector has come under stress. On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.

An investigation into Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd., initiated by its board after the death of founder V.G. Siddhartha, is likely to conclude that at least 20 billion rupees ($270 million) is missing from its accounts, according to people familiar with the matter.The months-long probe following the suicide of Siddhartha in July examined the financial transactions of India’s largest coffee chain and its dealings with dozens of private companies owned by the entrepreneur. The draft report, running more than a hundred pages, points to billions of rupees that have gone missing, said the people, asking not to be identified because the details aren’t public. It also highlights hundreds of transactions between the founder’s listed and personal businesses that were not conducted at arm’s length, they said.Though the report is in its final stages, the precise details could change before its release, expected as early as this week, the people said. The missing funds could total more than 25 billion rupees, one person said. “The investigation report is still a work in progress, and not finalized,” a spokesman for the company said. “The board of directors and the company are unaware of its content at this point of time. Hence it would be premature to speculate on the investigation findings.”

It took one week after the first U.S. case of Covid-19 with no overseas connection for Starbucks Corp. to temporarily ban customers from bringing in reusable coffee mugs. Judith Enck, a former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, was disappointed. Public health comes first, of course, but as the founder of the grassroots Beyond Plastics project, Enck had her doubts that returning to disposable cups would make anyone safer. Currency, for instance, is a notorious germ-carrier. “Will Starbucks now stop accepting cash?” she says. These are nervous times for activists working to wean the world off plastics. Until the novel coronavirus started its spread across the globe, 2020 appeared to be a year when meaningful plastic-use restrictions would finally take hold. A growing list of consumer companies—including Coca-Cola Co., which produces about 117 billion plastic bottles each year—had set targets to reduce their reliance on plastic packaging. France prohibited single-use plastic plates, cups, and cutlery starting January 1, and England will enact restrictions on plastic straws and stirrers starting in April. On March 1, New York joined a number of other cities around the world in banning the distribution of plastic shopping bags by retailers.

There used to be no need for termination clauses as buyers and sellers could eventually reconcile disagreements, said Sunao Nakamura, the company’s managing executive officer, who likened the contracts to marriages. But amid unprecedented market changes, parties now need an easier way out when things don’t work as expected, he said.

A rapidly spreading global pandemic didn’t stop Parisians from crowding public parks and pathways on the first, warm sunny weekend of the year — and then posting the evidence on Twitter and Instagram. The French government was watching. “We’ve also seen people getting together in parks, in bars that haven’t respected the order to close, as if somehow life hadn’t changed,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised address Monday evening, when he announced a countrywide lockdown on top of the government’s earlier efforts to close restaurants and cafes. “It’s not just you that you aren’t protecting — recent developments have shown that no one is invulnerable, not even the youngest of us.” The government is far from alone in expressing concern, especially after France recorded 900 new cases of the Covid-19 virus on Sunday and 400 hospitalizations. French Twitter users shared many images of busy public spaces yesterday using the hashtag #irresponsables to shame people who had left their homes to mingle with others in close quarters. Overnight, the images became a focus of public fear that France, like many countries, is mentally unprepared for what might be about to hit it.    Buttes Chaumont cet après-midi !Irresponsabilité en commun#CoronavirusFrance #CORONAVIRUSENFRANCE #PARIS #COVIDー19 #Irresponsables #RESTEZCHEZVOUS pic.twitter.com/EdG43v7uZJ This carefree behavior might seem thoughtless, but to be fair to Sunday’s park-goers, the French public has been receiving messages from officialdom that are not entirely clear. France held its first round of countrywide municipal elections on Sunday, despite objections from medical officials — including the head of a Parisian hospital group. In his latest address, Macron postponed the second round of voting, scheduled for March 22. Polling stations relied on disinfected pens, hand sanitizer and a carefully maintained distance between voters for the first round of elections — a less dramatic change from the usual routine than one might expect. Turnout was indeed markedly lower than the last national municipal vote in 2014, dropping 19 percentage points. Meanwhile, much of France appeared to be operating normally on Monday. In the Paris suburbs this morning, supermarkets were busy despite large gaps on the shelves, and the streets were still filled with pedestrians, cyclists and cars. This shows the endurance of engrained cultural habit. As Prime Minister Edouard Phillipe told news channel BFMTV: “I know it’s a concept that we’re averse to because us French people like to get together, he said. “We are a happy nation, happy to live together, even a bit more than usual when fear grips us.” Something deeper may also be at work. This is a crisis different from any that European countries have faced in a long time. When Paris suffered terror attacks in 2015, many residents refused to be cowed — to carry on as normal and thus not let anyone or anything that threatened everyday life beat them down. This “Keep Calm and Carry On” conditioning has sunk deep, and not just in France. In an era where courage has previously meant showing your face and gathering together with your fellow citizens, it may take a while before people realize that holing up and hiding is in fact the braver thing to do. If the virus’ spread is to be halted, it’s still an attitude that has to change, fast — as France’s Health Minister  Olivier Véran said Sunday in a TV interview. “We see grandparents who are happy with their grandchildren, and these are happy moments, it’s sunny — but I can tell you that the virus is invisible. It’s invisible and  threatens people’s lives, and I’m begging all French people watching to abide by the social distancing measures.”

The poster for the music festival reads “la musica no se detiene, ni siquiera en tiempos tan duros como este.” The music does not stop, even in times as hard as this. Over the next two weeks, a group of 30 musicians from Spain will livestream video performances from the confines of their homes. Instead of singing to their fans in person, they’ll meet them where they’re at in a nation under a coronavirus lockdown: In their bedrooms and living rooms. This is Cuarentena Fest, one of a growing number of global arts events born of quarantine.  Cello teachers are leading lessons via Skype and FaceTime, ballet teachers are choreographing over Instagram Live, and performers like Italian tenor Maurizio Marchini are finding resourceful ways of overcoming quarantine rules (he’s taken to singing opera selections on his balcony in locked-down Florence). The Berlin Philharmonic, which is closed to the public until April 19, offered a free stream of a rousing Béla Bartók concerto, which was performed for an empty concert hall. Cultural programming was an early victim of the coronavirus crisis. After a series of increasingly stringent restrictions on public spaces and events in global cities, theaters, museums and libraries shuttered their doors and residents were urged to stay home. Over the past week, in-person music and film festivals like South by Southwest, Coachella and Tribeca were postponed or canceled, touring acts were grounded, film production halted. By the weekend, it became clear that the performing arts in general — in opera houses, rock clubs, concert halls and venues from Broadway to high schools — would be going on an extended hiatus in civic life.   And in the most symbolically consequential blow, on March 12, one day after an usher who worked at two Broadway theaters tested positive for the coronavirus, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo called for a ban of all events over 500 people — including a temporary end to all Broadway shows until the week of April 13. The profound cultural loss of this mass silencing will be hard to quantify — escaping to new worlds will become only more vital as this one turns ever more grim; understanding others’ pain and joy more instructive as communities turn inward; laughing and listening more necessary to feel free as borders close. To cities and the artists that sustain them, the financial damage, too, will be immediate and profound. Broadway is one of the largest economic engines for New York City, bringing in around $1.8 billion in ticket sales last season; a month-long closure could mean $100 million in losses, Bloomberg News reports. Across the U.S., museums bring in an estimated $50 billion in revenue, including the spending they stimulate at surrounding businesses, and directly employ more than 350,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Live music ticket sales and sponsorships could have been worth $29 billion in 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated. “If we can’t congregate and showcase art and culture — whatever that means — a lot of people aren’t going to get paid,” said Shain Shapiro, the founder and CEO of Sound Diplomacy, which promotes economic development through music and nightlife, and holds global events. “I can understand that when you have to prioritize public health over everything else, then music, art and culture are the first things to go. We’re seeing we’re not a priority right now and I understand.” Some audiences can still enjoy art on screens. But the jobs associated with live, face-to-face entertainment are already drying up. When South by Southwest was cancelled, a third of its staff was laid off. Ten thousand union members of San Francisco’s entertainment and hospitality industry have been laid off, the San Francisco Labor Council told Time journalist Alana Semuels. “The impact on workers across the entertainment industry is unfathomable at this time,” said Laura Penn, executive director of the Stage Director and Choreographer’s Union, in a statement. The union represents 3,000 theater workers across the country. (Disclosure: The reporter’s mother is the executive board president of SDC.) Since those workers are primarily freelancers, they “rely on stable ecosystems of employers to make their lives work,” Penn continued. SDC’s immediate concern is keeping coverage for those who lose health insurance along with steady employment. “Many more needs will emerge as we begin to grasp the full measure of this crisis, but right now it’s health insurance.” Since so many workers in the entertainment industry string freelance gigs together instead of working for one employer year-round, closed shows mean both lost wages and gaps in health insurance coverage. The president and executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists called on federal, state and local governments to offer relief packages to artists around the country, few of whom would benefit from the payroll tax cut proposed by President Donald Trump. The coronavirus emergency aid package, approved by the House on March 14, would be more expansive for those who aren’t on company payrolls, offering two weeks paid sick leave, and increased unemployment benefit support. “[I]t appears inevitable that many of our companies will be forced to close for an unforeseen amount of time in order to combat COVID-19,” wrote American Guild of Musical Artists in a statement. “This measure, while drastic, will undoubtedly help our nation combat the virus. But we cannot lose sight of the human cost.” Performers and entertainers of all kinds are finding their livelihoods threatened. Paula Zimmerman is a Manhattan-based psychic — she makes a living doing palm and tarot card readings at parties and in private consultations. “January and February are usually my slow times, so I’ve already been behind on my rent,” she said. “It usually picks up when the weather starts to get warmer, but nobody is hiring now.” The events she was supposed to work at are canceled or not scheduled at all. And at 71, Zimmerman is at a higher risk for catching a more serious case of Covid-19 herself; she understands that entering people’s homes ups her chances of getting sick, too. But she’s also struggling to pay the bills. Every month this continues, she expects to lose about $1,200 in income. For now, she’s been withholding her rent in case she needs cash for a medical emergency. Luckily, her landlord hasn’t bothered her for a check yet, so she can save while still paying for things she can’t go without: her medication, and the agency fee that connects her with jobs, and her cable and electricity payments. Chris Griswold, who moved to Oakland in September to teach improv comedy in the Bay Area, is self-employed and doesn’t have a union to negotiate for him. Griswold has lived through disasters before: When Hurricane Sandy hit in New York, he was working at Trader Joe’s, which covered his pay for the week the store was closed. “I’m kind of missing having an employer like that right now,” he said. As Griswold postpones classes and cancels performances, he worries that — depending on how long the state of emergency lasts — the city’s grassroots and institutional arts scenes will be seriously deflated. “A lot of performance organizations are shutting down,” he said. “Nailing boards over the windows, metaphorically, until this shadow passes over humanity.” Griswold’s fears speak to a broader concern: That even after the moratoriums or immediate emergency measures end, the fabric of local arts scenes may be permanently damaged. “Small groups — string quartets, neighborhood dance schools, shoestring theater companies — operate on the thinnest of margins. Some will likely disappear,” wrote Justin Davidson in Vulture. “Audiences who are kept away for an extended period lose the habit and may not come back.” Emery Schaffer, a playwright and producer in New York City, had to cancel future performances of her play A My Name Is Allison, which opened this March, and another short play as part of a series at the Brunch Theatre. She had paid the team for Allison upfront, so they’re not losing wages due to lost ticket sales, but worries that The Tank, the independent theater that was hosting it, might not survive the blow. She’s encouraging people who refund their tickets to donate the proceeds back, and is hopeful that once this all blows over, the production will be able to run in the future. After graduating from NYU a few years ago, these were the first plays of hers to premiere. “I’m optimistic that we’ll get to do it again, but obviously that’s not the same for a lot of other people, and it’s a huge bummer,” she said. “Every time I open my phone, someone else’s dreams are crushed.” Shapiro, who’s based in the U.K. and has been in voluntary isolation since a coworker got sick, has a slightly more optimistic view — that the coronavirus blackouts will reinforce the importance of art in an increasingly distanced world. “This may force us to really rethink why we do what we do and how we do what we do,” he said. “The one thing that I believe and I hope — as a human being and as someone whose life is made sense through music and culture — is that this will promote a different kind of localism, and get them to recognize the impact and value that local artists, whatever the discipline, play in their life.” When it comes time for cities of all sizes to rebuild their cultural infrastructure, Shapiro says federal government incentive programs such as Opportunity Zones and Tax-Increment Financing should have clearer mandates to help support arts projects. “It’s so hard to access [that] financing for anything that’s not in the tens of millions,” he said, by way of example. “Why can’t you argue the economic benefit of something in 10 years’ time if it’s a recording studio or a dance company?” Schaffer, whose other stream of income comes from nannying, has gone home to Philadelphia to be with her parents. Even while isolated from New York’s theater community, she’s inspired by the calls for virtual collaboration she’s seeing on Facebook — people in her network are swapping contact info via Google Doc to share their writing, and doing readings of scripts over Zoom. “[It] really shows how strong the artist community really is, and how we want to do things even if we can’t,” she said. “It just shows the resilience of people who do this. It’s pretty amazing.” Last week, to help bring in a little income, Zimmerman started doing socially distanced psychic readings: She’ll tell you your future remotely, charging $7 for an email message or $10 for a phone call. “I hate to demean myself like that financially,” she said. “But I think a lot of people will have to start doing that: settle for less because of the circumstances.”

Mortgage prices rose and spreads tightened Monday morning as investors responded favorably to the Federal Reserve’s weekend announcement that it will resume net purchases of agency MBS for the first time since October 2014. As of 11 a.m. New York time, prices had surged across the entire conventional 30-year coupon stack, with the lower coupons -- the 2.5% and 3% -- easily besting their Treasury and swap hedges, buoyed in part by the fact those coupons will be the primary target of Fed purchases. The same outperformance was also seen in lower coupon Ginnie Mae II 30-year coupons.

The hit to New York’s restaurant industry from the novel coronavirus has been fast and devastating. A series of events that started on March 13, when several of the city’s most famous dining rooms—Le Bernardin, Daniel, and Smith & Wollensky, to name a few—announced they were closing indefinitely, has culminated in an order from Mayor Bill de Blasio to close all the city’s  restaurants and bars. Starting at 9 a.m. on March 17, restaurants will be open only for delivery and takeout. Similar rules have been put in place in states including Illinois, Massachusetts, and Ohio, as well as in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.  In response, industry activists are working to support imperiled, independently owned restaurants. Dining Bonds is an initiative started by hospitality executives. The model is simple: A $100 “bond” will be sold for $75 and can be cashed in for full value after the redemption date. (The money, however, is nonrefundable in the event that a restaurant closes permanently.) “It is meant to evoke the feeling of a wartime savings bond, which is what the industry feels like right now. Customers are investing in the future,” says Helen Patrikis of HR-PR and co-founder of the initiative with Steven Hall, president of Hall PR. The value of each bond, which is essentially a discounted gift certificate, will be determined by individual restaurants. Dining Bonds connects the diner and the restaurant; the restaurant’s landing page will have a designated place for the transaction. The program goes live on March 16. Almost three dozen restaurants have signed up, including James Beard-nominated Adda Indian Canteen and  Japanese sando specialists Hi-Collar in New York, as well as Million Dollar Cowboy Steakhouse in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and the fine-dining Vietnamese spot Crustacean in Beverly Hills. Grubhub Inc., the restaurant delivery platform, has announced the Community Relief Fund, which will earmark contributions—more than $1 million a month, the company says—from its Donate the Change program for charities that support workers and restaurants impacted by the virus. Grubhub is also temporarily deferring commission fees of as much as $100 million for independent restaurants across the country that have been affected by the coronavirus. The nonprofit Restaurant Workers Community Foundation, co-founded by Bloomberg Pursuits contributor John deBary, has also created a donation page to help people in the industry affected by the coronavirus, as well as a page that aggregates available resources. A familiar name has stepped into the relief game, too. On March 15,  José Andrés said he’s closing all of his ThinkFoodGroup restaurants in New York and Washington, D.C.—including  Mercado Little Spain at Hudson Yards and Zaytinya—to repurpose several of them as community kitchens. They will operate as takeout businesses with a limited menu and flexible pricing “for those that can’t afford to pay.” Andrés says it’s part of an effort from his nonprofit World Central Kitchen (although not directly tied to it) and the free meals they’ve distributed to crisis-hit places around the globe.

On November 27, 1910, New York City celebrated the opening of Pennsylvania Station. An estimated crowd of 100,000 came to see the new Beaux-Arts masterpiece. With slightly less fanfare, Sunnyside Yard in Queens came online that day as well. At the time, the 180-acre floodlit complex was the largest railroad yard in America, serving dozens of trains that now could go straight into Manhattan. The station is no more — torn down in the 1960s, to become an enduring symbol for the historic preservation movement. Its namesake railroad merged with the New York Central and has also gone the way of all flesh. But the rail yards live on, serving about 780 trains from Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor and commuter train lines each day. And in 2020 New York, Sunnyside Yard has become a much-coveted rarity: a large tract of undeveloped land in the biggest city in the United States. But that could be about to change. In 2014, Amtrak, while making its own upgrades to the yards, developed a partnership to use the land, and three years later, a study outlined the possibility of building a concrete deck over the yards to allow development on top of it. A steering committee made up of various stakeholders went through a series of neighborhood consultations and public workshops, and on March 3, Amtrak and New York City released its Sunnyside Yard master plan.* The development promises 12,000 homes, plus schools, libraries, a new commuter railroad station, a new subway line and a new bus line. “We’re living in a moment where a lot of needs are being identified,” says Vishaan Chakrabarti, the founder of Practice for Architecture and Urbanism (PAU) and the lead planner for the project. “We have a housing crisis. We have an infrastructure shortage. These are needs of the moment, but they’re not going away.” Chakrabarti touts the plan as a forward-thinking idea for a holistic neighborhood, which will be carbon-neutral and optimized for walkability and transit, not cars. PAU’s renderings of this future city-in-a-city show a utopian mix of sleek mid-rises amid abundant green space and bike paths. The Sunnyside Yard project has already drawn pointed comparisons with Hudson Yards, the privately funded enclave of luxury apartments and retail that debuted in Manhattan last year, amid near-universal criticism. But what’s planned for Sunnyside Yard will be a far bigger — the site is about six times the size of Hudson Yards — and, its backers say, fundamentally different: Its 12,000 housing units are designed to be affordable to low- and middle-income families. If it’s built, it would be the largest such housing project built in New York City since the early 1970s. Grech, president and chief operating officer of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, sees the Queens project as a potential national model for a transit-oriented mega-development. “It’s a monumental time, similar to when they built the World Trade Center and then re-envisioned it after 9/11. They’re kind of once-in-a-lifetime things, but you have to do it right, and I think we’re on the track to do it right.” Not everyone in Queens agrees — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dropped out of the Sunnyside steering committee in February, citing lack of community input on the direction of the project. And the development faces a host of other, more technical challenges. There’s a good reason why this big opportunity remained untapped for so long: It’s very difficult and expensive to deck over working railroad yards, particularly if you’re going to build large structures on top of them. Cost estimates for Sunnyside Yard have ranged from $16 billion to $22 billion. But with open land in New York City scarce and housing prices sky-high, the allure of activating this site is strong. “As Long Island City has become more and more densely developed, it only makes the site even more appealing,” says former New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger.   It’s not, however, the first time developers have tried to build big things here. Through the years, several ambitious projects have been advanced for the Sunnyside site. “There have been arguments about putting all kinds of things there for years,” says Jason Antos, president of the Queens Historical Society. “But they never got off the drawing board.” Among those schemes was a high-rise office/transit hub pitched in the 1930s and in 2014, a failed plan to relocate the city’s convention center there. But most builders who eyed the railyard over the second half of the 20th century saw it as the perfect place for major sports venues. That reflected geography, in part: Sunnyside Yard is transit-accessible and close to the geographical center of the five boroughs of New York City. But it was also driven by the dreams of a borough that had no major league sports. In the 1950s, as Major League Baseball embarked on a period of expansion and franchise-shuffling, Queens jockeyed for a team of its own, and the status it could confer. At that time, the Dodgers owned Brooklyn, the Giants played at the aging Polo Grounds at the northern tip of Manhattan, and the Yankees were just across the Harlem River in the Bronx. “People looked to Queens like the Wild West,” Major League Baseball historian John Thorn says. “It was the new frontier. There was land to be had. It’s the same way New Yorkers looked at Brooklyn in the 1830s.” When Giants owner Horace Stoneham considered moving his team –- likely to Minneapolis, where their top minor league club was, Thorn says –- the Queens Chamber of Commerce offered in 1956 to make the club the central tenant of a stadium that would be the centerpiece of an entertainment center built atop Sunnyside Yard. “The Giants are still having trouble finding a new home with adequate parking and close to rapid transit,” Queens Chamber vice president A. Edward MacDougall wrote in his proposal. “Just considering those requirements, nothing in the entire City of New York compares with our Queens site. It’s the geographical center of New York City.” Instead, the Giants decamped for California, and Queens baseball would have to wait until 1964, when the Mets, an expansion team formed two years earlier, moved into a new stadium at Flushing Meadows. A decade later, Sunnyside Yard, by then run by the Penn Central railroad, was again touted as the site for a sports venue — this time in an interstate squabble between New York and New Jersey, as well as an intrastate squabble within the Empire State itself. Plans were underway for what would become known as the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1973 when New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller announced the state would sell $275 million in bonds for a new complex at Sunnyside Yard, including a 1,000-room resort and convention hotel, parking for 20,000 cars, and an 80,000-seat NFL stadium. The project drew the ire of New Jersey –- there were only so many large sports tenants to go around, even in New York — as well as borough and New York City officials, who said they weren’t consulted. Ultimately, the plans were undone by concerns over traffic, a common refrain for any large-scale project in New York, and the bankruptcy of the Penn Central, which delayed the project enough for it to get lapped by the Meadowlands. One of the real estate developers scavenging the Penn Central was a Queens native named Donald Trump. After turning the railroad’s former Commodore Hotel into the Trump Grand Hyatt, he’d bought the New Jersey Generals of the upstart USFL in 1984. Intent on making the Generals New York City’s team, he promised to build a “Trump Stadium” within the five boroughs and cast an eye toward Sunnyside Yard, but the stadium he announced plans for would be near Shea Stadium in Flushing Meadows. Ultimately, Trump led the USFL into oblivion, and Sunnyside Yard remained a home only for trains. Yet another stadium scheme came via New York City’s bid for the 2012 Olympics. That effort formally proposed building a stadium over the West Side Yards, which would be used after the Games for the New York Jets –- and possibly the Mets as well. Sunnyside Yard was also considered, but probably not that seriously, Goldberger says. “That site would have been ideal for [the Mets’] Citi Field, which would have given it a more urban location than the present one,” says Goldberger, author of the 2019 book Ballpark: Baseball in the American City. “I don’t recall that there was ever a public discussion of it, however, so the consideration of it for the Mets must have been brief and fairly superficial.” Ultimately, the Mets built Citi Field next to Shea Stadium. In today’s New York, where mostly vacant supertalls loom over some of the most expensive real estate in America, there’s really no appetite for a sports venue at Sunnyside Yard, much less the acres of parking lots that such stadiums usually require. Other priorities are far more pressing. “There’s a huge need for affordable housing, and projects like [a stadium] would make housing less affordable,” Antos notes. The master plan presented by PAU, with its transit-oriented virtues and emphasis on efficient and sustainable urban living, might not have the razzle-dazzle of past plans for skyscrapers, convention centers, and stadium-anchored entertainment complexes. But to Chakrabarti, it’s just as grandiose. Because of the involvement of local, state and federal interests, a governing authority will likely have to be created to oversee the project; the will to get it built, Chakrabarti says, will be a referendum on who we are as Americans. “We have to recall the country that built projects like Hoover Dam and went to the moon,” he says. “Can we still think big and build things by the public, for the public? This is still a moon shot. But it’s the right moon shot.”*CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify the role of Amtrak and the City of New York.

In June 1899, the steamer Nippon Maru arrived at Honolulu carrying one passenger who had died during the trans-Pacific voyage. The Hawaii Board of Health immediately quarantined the ship for a week as a precaution against the bubonic plague, which was then ravaging much of Asia. The freighter departed for San Francisco without further fatalities, but rats and fleas aboard the ship managed to break the quarantine. In December, plague took a first victim in Honolulu’s crowded Chinatown. The epidemic that reached Honolulu had originated in China in the 1870s, spreading slowly until it reached the commercial cities of Guangzhou and then Hong Kong in 1899. Steamships may not have been as fast as modern jetliners, but they still linked Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas into a global economy — and a global disease network. Honolulu, booming as a Pacific entrepôt, was especially determined to fend off what many saw as an Asiatic threat. Disease outbreaks are often racialized and made vehicles for nativist beliefs and ethnic hatreds. In 2020, some commentators continue to misleadingly and dangerously call Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, the “Chinese flu” — a term that has helped to trigger anti-Asian harassment in the United States and Europe. That rhetoric has been encouraged by some conservative political leaders: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy prefers “Chinese coronavirus,” while Mike Pompeo insists on “Wuhan coronavirus.” President Donald Trump has frequently vowed to defend Americans against a “foreign virus.” As this March 17 tweet from a CBS reporter indicates, other, less-veiled terms appear to be circulating at the White House.  This morning a White House official referred to #Coronavirus as the “Kung-Flu” to my face. Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back. Racism was even more blatant at the turn of the 20th century. Noting that white people in Asia were less likely to contract plague than were locals, so-called experts attributed the difference to inherent racial superiority and proper European habits rather than economic advantage and colonial privilege. Historian James Mohr, author of the 2004 book Plague and Fire: Battling Black Death and the 1900 Burning of Honolulu’s Chinatown, described how one Honolulu resident spoke for many when she optimistically wrote that “plague seldom attacks clean white people.”   Asian immigrant communities in the cities of the American West in that era were already viewed as exotic nuisances, easy to romanticize for tourists and easy to raid in vice crackdowns. Police officials could stand four-square for virtue by raiding opium parlors and back rooms where Asian gamblers played fan tan while ignoring more-numerous gambling joints and saloons with white customers. Tour guides in San Francisco manufactured a fake narrative of danger and depravity, leading visitors on rambles through Chinatown basements and hiring local residents as fake denizens of opium dens. Novelist Frank Norris titled an 1897 article about San Francisco’s Chinese neighborhood “The Third Circle,” in a reference to Dante’s seven circles of hell, and called the neighborhood a “noisome swamp.” The very existence of Chinatowns in cities like Vancouver, Portland, and San Francisco gave residents of European heritage the thrill of confronting the “other” while remaining firmly in charge. It was a short step from seeing Asians as a social threat to fearing that the segregated communities in which they lived — undeniably crowded and unsanitary in many cases — posed physical dangers as sources of disease. These fears came to a climax in Honolulu, whose “Chinatown” housed 3,000 Chinese, 1,500 Japanese, and 1,000 Native Hawaiian residents in densely packed two-story wooden buildings, backyard shacks, and shanties with little fresh water and terrible sanitation. When plague appeared in December 1899, public health officials first quarantined the neighborhood, responding simultaneously to concrete epidemiological concerns and to fears that Asian residents might contaminate the entire community. Hard-working Chinese and Japanese saw the action as one more example of race-based discrimination. In a blog post for Oxford University Press last week, Mohr observed: Since the early victims were Chinese, ugly cries arose for the destruction of all Asian neighborhoods on the pretext that they seemed to be breeding grounds for plague; blaming victims and increased hostility toward minorities had been hallmarks of health-related panics since ancient times. The Board of Health also attempted to sanitize with fire, burning buildings where plague victims had died. On January 20, 1900, a controlled burn roared out of control, consuming a fifth of Honolulu’s buildings and the homes of 5,000 people. White residents who had come to gawk at the fire also gathered with baseball bats and pick handles, to ensure that the fire victims ended up in tightly controlled refugee camps. The Honolulu fire was a particularly vivid illustration of how Americans apply racialized assumptions of disease transmission, but many others can be found throughout the 20th century. In some cases, public health panics disguise other motives. The Board of Health in Reno, Nevada, razed most of that city’s Chinatown in 1908 in the name of cleanliness and morality, conveniently making land available for redevelopment. When bubonic plague appeared in Los Angeles in 1924, authorities quarantined the Mexican-American neighborhood south of downtown, destroying hundreds of homes in the name of sanitation. In his book Whitewashed Adobe: The Rise of Los Angeles and the Remaking of Its Mexican Past, historian William Deverell writes that “the destruction of these homes and shacks was part of an overall plan,” in which Mexican-American residents were first declared to be public health nuisances so that no compensation would need to be paid. The Reno and Los Angeles actions had the same effect as the destruction of black Tulsa in 1921, eliminating competition and promoting real estate development, minus the murdering mobs. And it’s not a long reach from the real public health threats of plague to the metaphorical disease of “blight” that disproportionately afflicted African-American and Latino neighborhoods in the urban renewal era. Unlike Reno and Los Angeles, the actions in Honolulu were ill-fated but not explicitly malign. Burning Chinatown was a tragic accident, not a plan. The disaster reflected ignorance as well as racism: Unfamiliar with plague, health officials deployed quarantine measures that had worked against cholera a few years earlier, unaware that the diseases are transmitted differently. After the fire, the plague slowly subsided, although it appeared at Kahului on Maui, where another small Chinatown was burned in February. Some Japanese and Chinese residents rebuilt on the ashes, but many dispersed into other parts of Honolulu. The U.S. government eventually provided partial compensation for property losses. At the same time, officials could not escape their belief that racial minorities and outsiders were responsible for spreading the “foreign bacillus” from China among white Americans. Among certain leaders, that same reflexive understanding seems to be alive and well today.

Don’t even think about socially isolating from coronavirus in a vacation home. This was the message from Norway’s government this weekend, as the global coronavirus pandemic started to spread across the country. Prime Minister Erna Solberg spoke Saturday to order urbanites holed up in rural cabins to return to their regular homes in the cities. On Monday, the government doubled down, warning that anyone not staying at their home address faced a fine of 20,000 Norwegian Crowns ($1,952) or 15 days in jail. The penalties are harsh, but there is reasoning behind them. Summer houses are extremely common across Scandinavia, while the permanent population of many rural areas is small and often thinly spread. Picturesque areas such as Hallingdal, a mountain valley halfway between Norway’s two largest cities, have wildly fluctuating populations, with only 21,000 residents in winter but 120,000 in summer. Small-town mayors have been warning that if large numbers of people decamp to their municipalities from Oslo and Bergen and then fall ill, things could get ugly. Not only would the virus be likely to spread faster, but local hospital facilities might be unable to deal with the volume of sick patients. City-dwellers are thus much better off staying home where hospital beds and health care will be more widely available if needed, the argument goes. This message may resonate with people in other parts of the world, where rural facilities also typically have far more limited capacity. Few other countries are likely to see population fluctuations from summer homes quite as dramatic as Norway’s, so the risks may not be quite as high. But if enough people relocate from their current homes to socially isolate in more pastoral settings, local governments’ capacity to plan for treatment will be affected. It’s at least worth thinking about what your health-care options might be before you set off.

Moving ahead with the Olympics this summer in Tokyo would be “insensitive and irresponsible,” according to Canadian ice hockey player and International Olympic Committee member Hayley Wickenheiser. In the most direct comments yet by an IOC member, Wickenheiser said on her Twitter account that the games shouldn’t be held. “Athletes can’t train,” she said. “Attendees can’t travel plan. Sponsors and marketers can’t market with any degree of sensitivity.” I’ve given this a lot of thought, and over the past few days my perspective has changed. I was voted to represent and protect athletes. As an IOCAC member, 6x Olympian and Medical doctor in training on the front lines in ER up until this week,these are my thoughts on @Olympics : pic.twitter.com/vrvfsQZ1GO Wickenheiser sits on the IOC athlete committee, and is a former member of its medical committee. Her comments come just hours after the IOC’s executive board, of which she is not a member, said it remained dedicated to holding the 2020 Summer Games from July 24 to Aug. 9. That said, the IOC’s tone around the event is changing. After weeks of refusing to entertain the idea that the games might be disrupted, the executive board on Tuesday softened its tone significantly. It acknowledged an “unprecedented situation,” and one that is “changing day by day.” Planning for the Tokyo Games has been underway for a decade. The games have a direct budget of nearly $6 billion, with some 11,000 athletes and 600,000 spectators expected to attend. Wickenheiser participated in five Winter Games as an athlete, winning gold medals in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014, and silver in 1998. She also competed in the 2000 Summer Games in softball. “I can only imagine and try to empathize with the anxiety and heartbreak athletes are feeling right now,” she said. “The uncertainty of not knowing where you’re going to train tomorrow, as facilities close and qualification events are canceled all over the world, would be terrible if you’ve been training your whole life for this.” Read more: Will Coronavirus Take Out the 2020 Tokyo Olympics?: QuickTake

California lawmakers approved an emergency $500 million spending package to help combat the coronavirus pandemic. The money will be used to lease two hospitals, finance equipment and assist clinics, nursing homes and other facilities. Some of the funds will pay for cleaning daycare centers so they can remain open and to help stop the spread of the virus among the homeless. The legislation allows for another $500 million appropriation if needed.

On Monday afternoon, the Bay Area became the first region in the U.S. to institute a shelter in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19, barring visits to restaurants or bars or the hair salon, having friends over, and taking unnecessary public transit trips. The restriction made another recent San Francisco measure all-the-more urgent: keeping people housed while they deal with the cascading economic toll of such an emergency. As other cities consider escalating their own lockdowns in the coming days, they are already following the lead of San Francisco by pursuing eviction freezes, foreclosure pauses, and utility shut-off deferrals. Over the past few days, the states of California and New York, and cities including Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Seattle, and Philadelphia have taken up a range of housing security strategies, hoping to avoid exacerbating the public health crisis posed by Covid-19 by pushing more people into homelessness. These efforts follow earlier measures in Singapore and Italy to stem homelessness during outbreaks there. Across the U.S., The Guardian reports that almost 90 cities and states have stopped shutting off people’s water utilities, even if they can’t afford to pay their bills. Detroit is one of the few cities that has taken this measure a step further, restoring water access to tens of thousands of poor residents whose taps had previously been shut off due to debt. The U.S. has not passed a blanket national moratorium (although the federal government has taken steps to suspend some government-backed evictions and foreclosures). But Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called for federal lawmakers to prevent all evictions, foreclosures, and utility bill collections. Because each jurisdiction handles housing policy differently, officials are pulling different levers to protect renters and homeowners alike: Penalizing landlords for kicking tenants out, telling their police and sheriff’s departments to stop enforcing pending or new eviction notices, and urging banks and utility companies to temporarily forgive non-payments. Several of the proposals recognize the financial burden of mass social isolation and business closures by tying the housing reprieves to documented coronavirus-related losses. Others take a blanket approach to protecting people from housing insecurity during a global pandemic. “People shouldn’t lose or be forced out of their home because of the spread of COVID-19,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement, after he issued an executive order giving local governments the authority to impose their own moratoria. “Over the next few weeks, everyone will have to make sacrifices — but a place to live shouldn’t be one of them. I strongly encourage cities and counties take up this authority to protect Californians.” Tenants’ rights organizations said that the measure was disappointing because it didn’t bar evictions outright at the state level. Meanwhile, in cities like San Jose and San Francisco, lawmakers have already taken up their authority, and are finalizing measures that freeze evictions for a set period of time. Both require affected tenants to demonstrate some kind of coronavirus-related loss. San Francisco, whose mayor London Breed enacted the eviction moratorium on March 13, is also working on more non-binding resolutions that would urge banks and utility companies to freeze foreclosures and utility debt. In Los Angeles — where 63% of the city’s 4 million residents are renters, and a third of them pay half or more of their earned income on rent — Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive order to halt evictions for struggling tenants. Documented child-care, domestic-care, or health-care expenses could prove need, as well as work stoppages; and rent would be due six months after the state of emergency ends. Some other cities whose constituents have pushed them to take action say they’re looking to their states or counties to act first, due to preemption measures or court powers. Even without issuing a legislative moratorium on landlord-initiated evictions, however, cities can direct (or urge) law enforcement to stand down and stop expelling people from their homes, or halt court proceedings already in motion. In the Miami area, for example, an immediate halt on evictions came not from a proposal through city council, but directly from the police department: After Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez declared a state of emergency on March 11, the department announced it was temporarily suspending its own activities to enforce evictions “until further notice,” effectively halting tenants’ removals. Law enforcement in Philadelphia, which ranks fourth in the nation for eviction filings, started collaborating with the city after Councilmember Helen Gym successfully lobbied the city’s sheriff and its courts to stop enforcing evictions, residential foreclosures, and tax liens on residential properties for at least the next two weeks. Just this week, more than 550 evictions were scheduled to be heard — as part of the emergency eviction pause, the courts also agreed to pause hearing those cases already in the pipeline. During those two weeks, major gas, electric, and WiFi utilities won’t pursue shut-offs, either. “We know that one of the most dangerous things we can do at this time — when we’re telling people to stay at home or be in safe places — is to take away a roof over people’s heads, or turn off their water or electricity because they’re not allowed to work right now,” Gym told CityLab. New York State is currently the area experiencing the largest number of coronavirus cases — more than 1,300 and climbing fast — and lawmakers there are attacking housing insecurity from all sides. After New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state disaster emergency, state legislators Brad Hoylman and Brian Kavanagh submitted legislation that would prohibit landlords from evicting tenants without a court order, and gives new powers to courts to stop evictions, foreclosures, and “adjust lease obligations.” The state courts took their own decisive action over the weekend, issuing an indefinite end to eviction proceedings at the residential and commercial level, and a stall on all pending housing court orders across the state. This order extends New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s own commitment to suspend evictions in the city for three months. Oakland, too, is taking a two-pronged approach. Under pressure from housing activists last week, Oakland’s city council sent a letter asking the county to pause evictions until the council’s next meeting on April 7; the Superior Court agreed, stopping all court proceedings, including evictions, under the Bay Area’s shelter in place. In the meantime, Councilmember Nikki Fortunato Bas also successfully called on the Alameda County Sheriff’s office to stop pursuing eviction enforcement. But she says a city-imposed moratorium is crucial. “I think it’s very important to look comprehensively,” Bas said. “Ensuring that eviction protections are strong, including moratoriums on evictions due to this pandemic; and ensuring that eviction proceedings that may already be in the works be halted, and that any court orders aren’t pursued.” Even San Francisco’s original legislation — which paused evictions for unpaid rent — left gaps: San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston  introduced another measure that would bar no-fault evictions, like owner move-ins or renovations, after landlords ejected a “medically disabled Mission resident,” using the state’s Ellis Act, Mission Local reported. (“[S]ome landlords seem to be lacking a heart or a brain or both,” Preston wrote on Twitter.) He’s also struggling to ensure that the San Francisco court system doesn’t proceed with eviction trials. And although L.A. has ensured that the most precarious tenants are protected, Councilmember Mike Bonin told CityLab he’s planning to introduce a more sweeping suite of legislation at a future city council meeting. He’ll also ask for a freeze on evictions, but his legislation wouldn’t require any documentation of work disruption, and it would go through the city attorney. For those who can document coronavirus economic impacts, he’s seeking another more specific mandate that forces all landlords and residential mortgage-holders to allow tenants and homeowners up to 24 months to fulfill their payment obligations. And, to ensure that people won’t be stuck looking for housing amidst a downturn due to a poorly timed lease end date, Bonin says this draft of his legislation would require all residential landlords to extend expiring leases for three months after the emergency declaration is lifted. “In this crisis we have to do everything that we possibly can — everything we know we can do. And we need to push the envelope of what that is,” he said. “One or two weeks of lost income is the difference between [some workers] living indoors and them living outdoors.” Mom-and-pop landlords have expressed concerns that this new trend would have unintended consequences, pushing property owners behind on their own payments as they, too, grapple with the financial and health implications of the virus. In cities where eviction moratoriums are paired with foreclosure forgiveness, they have less to worry about. Cities like L.A. and Philadelphia are pursuing small business support funds. And San Francisco announced a moratorium on coronavirus-related evictions for small and medium businesses, a move permitted by California’s new executive order. “If this goes on, we’re going to have to look at using city, state and federal money to help keep people whole,” said Bonin. “We’ve got tenants, we’ve got workers, we’ve got small businesses, we’ve got landlords — it just becomes a self-perpetuating and constantly repeating cycle of harm.” To break out of this cycle, localities can’t be the only ones legislating on the ground, says Philadelphia’s Gym, who calls on President Donald Trump to adopt Sanders’ national housing relief directive and enact expanded paid leave, cash assistance, or a universal basic income on a temporary basis. “People are in crisis,” she said. “All of us need to make a broad-based appeal for state and federal relief that comes directly to states and large cities.”

Visit any major business school these days, and you’ll find students like Juan Adorno. The 31-year-old former product development and strategy worker was drawn to the University of Vermont’s Grossman School of Business for the one-year sustainable innovation MBA it offers and the edge he felt it would give him in the workplace. “As environmental, social, and governance investing has increased in popularity and become so important for asset managers, it became a growing part of my world,” Adorno says. “I’m looking for an organization that is corporately socially responsible, that holds true to its mission, and has a sense of more than profit.” Responding to the demand from students like Adorno and commitments from companies and investors around diversity and sustainability, Harvard Business School, NYU Stern, Copenhagen Business School, and a clutch of other top universities now offer ESG-focused MBAs or individual classes on topics such as corporate social responsibility (CSR). But even as such coursework is being offered more widely, the people tapping the pool of graduates have yet to give adherence to ESG standards the same priority. In a  survey of MBA recruiters conducted by Bloomberg Businessweek last year, 1 in 4 said they valued a candidate’s problem-solving skills most. Following ESG standards was ranked last, with only 1 in every 500 recruiters saying it was the most important skill. It was ranked in the top five by recruiters 1.2% of the time. Employers rank in order the top 5 qualities they consider critical in graduates whom they hire

 Percentages show the number of times a quality is prioritized 1-5 in a survey  That means a new graduate hoping for a career in sustainable accounting or to land a CSR position in private industry is probably still going to need to emphasize more traditional expertise. For now, ESG seems to be just a nice-to-have skill for job candidates. “If I’m recruiting for my team, I want them to do the job I want them to do,” says Jean-Philippe Verdier of Verdier & Co. Corporate Advisory, which has recruited from Imperial College London and London Business School. “ESG is just one matter for me.” Business schools may also be turning to ESG because it’s an effective way to lure applicants. According to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey, 77% of millennials are interested in social-impact investing and ownership, more than double the proportion of baby boomers. “Business schools have to pay attention to their customers,” says Lee Mergy, co-founder of Galt & Co., a management consultancy firm that works with Fortune 250 companies. “Their customers are as much, if not more, the candidates applying to those schools, as they are the businesses trying to pull candidates from them.” Certainly those at HEC Paris feel strongly about ESG. When a manifesto was started 18 months ago, about 400 out of the school’s 1,000 grande école graduates signed it to declare that they would not work for a company that wasn’t engaged in reducing its ecological footprint. The number of signatories has since grown to more than 35,000 to include those outside HEC, which includes a sustainability and disruptive innovation track on its MBA, as well as a number of electives. Other schools have acted on similar demands: Harvard Business School developed an impact investing course in 2017, while New York University’s Stern School of Business in 2016 started the Center for Sustainable Business, run by Tensie Whelan, formerly of the Rainforest Alliance. As a Master in Sustainability grows more common, businesses may be able to better discern the exact skills, in the same way they do with a Master of Finance. At the moment, companies are struggling to evaluate them, says Rodolphe Durand, professor of strategy and business policy at HEC Paris. “These new competencies, these new themes, are not in their dashboard,” Durand says. “They don’t know how to assess or quantify candidates.” Durand recently met with a CAC 40-listed company in France, which said bonuses of executives and managers are tied to their ESG impact. Those firms are having their human-resources professionals developing ways to measure ESG capabilities, he says. Recruiters may have a role to play, too, in spurring firms to give a higher priority to ESG expertise, says Mary Francia, a recruiter with Odgers Berndtson who works with European business school INSEAD. “It’s my job to make sure a client realizes it should be on their checklist,” Francia says.

Amazon.com Inc. is prioritizing the stocking of household staples and medical supplies as it struggles to deal with a surge in demand for online orders from customers avoiding stores during the coronavirus pandemic. The world’s biggest online retailer said in a blog post updated on Tuesday morning that it was making the move “so we can more quickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.” The aim is to keep warehouses stocked with the items people are buying now -- toilet paper, bleach and sanitizing wipes -- so Amazon is temporarily not accepting shipments of non-essential goods like flat-screen televisions and toys. The Seattle-based company wants to be perceived as an indispensable service, which is hard to do when items are out of stock and customers have to wait days for orders to be delivered. The company is fine-tuning its operation to quickly deliver things people need right now, sacrificing sales from its deep inventory for the time being. As online orders spike, Amazon also is looking to hire 100,000 people willing to pick, pack and deliver orders as a pandemic rages. Already, at least five workers at warehouses in Spain and Italy have contracted the coronavirus, and those numbers could rise in the coming months as the disease spreads in Europe and the U.S. If enough workers get sick, Amazon could be forced to close some of its fulfillment centers, potentially putting its vaunted delivery machine in peril. In the meantime, Amazon is telling third-party sellers that it won’t accept shipments from them in other product categories through at least April 5. Amazon said it was taking a similar approach with the big brands it buys directly from. “We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,” an Amazon spokesman said in an emailed statement. Products already on their way to Amazon warehouses will be accepted, he said. The new prioritization applies to restocking, not Amazon’s shipments of items already sitting on warehouse shelves. The change only limits products sold through Fulfillment by Amazon, a service through which online merchants pay Amazon to store, pack and ship their products sold on the site. Amazon’s marketplace merchants can continue to sell non-essential products, but they have to manage packing and shipping to customers on their own. ”There are going to be sellers who get hit hard, like people who have no way to ship outside of Fulfillment by Amazon,” said Will Tjernlund, an e-commerce consultant in Minneapolis who helps 30 brands sell on Amazon. “But it shouldn’t be the end of the world for too many people since there appears to be an end in sight.”

Norm Hullinger was heading into work one day in October when he got a call that his company’s network was acting up. It was no simple glitch. Hackers had started freezing the data of Alphabroder, a sportswear distributor. They wanted more than $3 million to restore it. Grappling with whether to pay, Hullinger, the chief executive officer, embarked on a journey that’s increasingly familiar to law firms,  hospitals, and cities that have found themselves on the other end of  negotiations with ransomware criminals. Even as experts raise alarms about the spread and increasing sophistication of such attacks, incursions on companies such as Hullinger’s have remained almost entirely out of the public view. That’s likely because a private equity firm, Littlejohn & Co., owns the business. Since private equity firms rely on their reputations as savvy investors to woo pension funds, wealthy individuals, and other clients, they aren’t keen to publicly admit that they or one of their companies has been hit by a ransomware attack. “Most of the time with ransomware attacks, private equity firms don’t report it,” says Dan Burke, who heads the national cyber practice at insurance brokerage Woodruff Sawyer. “There’s under-reporting due to reputational damage.” According to more than a dozen experts in cybersecurity, private equity, and insurance, ransomware attackers see the companies in private equity portfolios as rich targets. After all, the owners have deep pockets. At the same time, they’ve generally bought the companies with the goal of raising profits, and this often results in lean cybersecurity operations. Best of all for the attackers, these people say, targets aren’t hard to find: Private equity firms themselves have detailed disclosure requirements, and when they acquire a company, they often announce it with a press release. “You’re telling attackers you’re going to inject a large amount of capital into a company that presumably has valuable intellectual property,” says Mike O’Malley, vice president at Radware, a cybersecurity firm, of the buyout announcements. “It’s like giving them a road map to the pot of gold.” There are no statistics to show that private equity companies are hit more often than others. But the industry has been victim of a growing number of targeted and increasingly sophisticated attacks. “The private equity community as a whole is very concerned,” says Gregory Garrett, head of cybersecurity at BDO Digital, a technology advisory firm. He recently gave a talk on the subject to about 40 industry executives at a large private equity firm on New York’s Park Avenue that he declined to identify. “The major banks have invested an extraordinary amount of money in hardware, software, and training,” he says. “The private equity firms have not.” Ransomware attackers are moving away from the scattershot “spray and pray” attacks on many organizations at once and focusing more on “big game” that promise bigger paydays, according to ransomware experts. Attackers may explore company networks for weeks or months before encrypting data. They’ve also started threatening to make company data public unless payments are made, either to bolster the ransom demand or as a second part of the scam. These criminal rings also appear to search out operational details, such as who approves large payments or names of key employees, that can help them penetrate a network—just the sorts of specifics that private equity firms, as registered investment advisers, are required to file. Some experts who respond to ransomware crises say they’ve seen attacks apparently triggered by acquisition announcements. Austin Berglas of the cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant says he’s helped respond in recent months to attacks on five private equity portfolio companies, including ones focused on cosmetics, e-commerce, technology, and finance. While the FBI strongly advises against paying ransom, many companies do it anyway—perhaps 50% to 85% of those who call in experts to handle the attacks, according to several of the experts, including ones summoned to negotiate with attackers. Many private equity companies are paying for cyber insurance policies that cover ransomware attacks, which can include ransom payments and the cost of restoring operations. Insurance brokerage Aon Plc has arranged cyber insurance policies for the portfolio companies of more than 20 private equity firms, says Christian Hoffman, an executive at the firm. To get coverage, private equity firms have to show their cyber defenses are strong, Hoffman says. “Private equity firms are taking cyber and security very seriously,” he says. Some of the attacks have delayed or killed private equity deals. Aon executive Eric Friedberg described two $1 billion dollar-plus acquisitions that were delayed for a month or more by ransomware attacks while the private equity firms evaluated the cyber-security risks of the companies they were selling. Two years ago, an e-commerce company that had been in business for several years was close to being acquired by a private equity firm when ransomware hackers struck. The attack spanned five days. Spooked by the computer security lapses the attack had exposed, the private equity suitors withdrew their buyout offer, according to Chris Duvall, a senior director at the Chertoff Group, who declined to identify the firms. “Regardless of whether you pay or not, you have to rebuild your network,” says Charles Carmakal, a FireEye vice president who leads a team that has responded to more than 1,000 security breaches. “You have to remove back doors. If an attacker wanted, they could come back in right away and redeploy ransomware.” Not all ransomware attacks end up with companies resuming normal operations. Last August, Denver-based printing firm Colorado Timberline announced on its Facebook page that its computers had been infected. The attack came two years after private equity firms Frontenac and Charter Oak Equity acquired the company. “We have recently been plagued by several IT events, unfortunately we were unable to overcome the most recent ransomware attack,” its website stated. The company, with estimated revenues of about $23 million and 100 employees, closed. Frontenac, which declined to comment, and Charter Oak Equity, which did not respond to requests for comment, were left to share proceeds of a liquidation sale with other stakeholders. Details about the attack on Alphabroder emerged after Hullinger discussed it at a November industry conference. Video of his comments was posted on YouTube. In those remarks, he said he understood within hours that his company’s network, which processes some 40,000 orders a day, faced a ransomware attack. The firm’s cyberinsurer introduced forensics experts and negotiators who were on the job within hours. (Alphabroder and Littlejohn declined to comment, as did Hullinger.) The negotiators managed to cut the Russian-speaking criminals’ initial $3.2 million ransom roughly in half. “I’m not the type of person where, if someone in the street says ‘Give me your wallet,’ I’m going to hand it over,” Hullinger told conference participants. But he agreed to pay. The day after the attack, Alphabroder received a decryption key. The company was back working at full speed two days after the attack.

Four members of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, including superstar Kevin Durant, have tested positive for the coronavirus, just days after the NBA halted play to help contain the outbreak. Durant told the Athletic that he’s feeling fine after learning of the test result. Earlier Tuesday, the team announced one of the four unidentified players had exhibited symptoms of coronavirus. All four are isolated and under the care of team doctors. Kevin Durant Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg The Nets tested the team after returning from a road trip to San Francisco, and the results came back Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the situation. The team paid a private company to conduct the tests, the person said. One player woke up with some aches on Tuesday, but the rest have experienced no symptoms. The Nets are notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working with state and local health authorities. The NBA stopped play last week to help prevent the spread of the virus, and Tuesday’s announcement confirmed that players are at risk. The rest of the team and members of the traveling party are being asked to isolate, monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team doctors. “The health of our players and staff is of the highest priority to the organization, and the team is doing everything within its power to ensure that those affected receive the best care possible,” the team said in a statement. The NBA suspended play after a member of the Utah Jazz tested positive. Since then, almost all global sports have ceased play. At least seven NBA players have tested positive, the New York Times said Tuesday.

The International Olympic Committee remains committed to holding the Tokyo Olympics this year and is confident steps taken around the world will help contain the novel coronavirus, but the group is now talking in more cautious terms about the potential fallout from the pandemic. “With more than four months to go before the games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage,” the IOC said Tuesday in a statement. “Any speculation at this moment would be counterproductive.” Instead of harsh denials and refusals to acknowledge the games could be in jeopardy, the IOC now says it is an “unprecedented situation,” one that is “changing day by day.” Any big decision -- to hold, cancel or postpone the games -- will come with the health and well-being of the athletes as the top priority, the IOC said. “The IOC’s decision will not be determined by financial interests,” the committee said. “Thanks to its risk management policies and insurance it will in any case be able to continue its operations and accomplish its mission to organize the Olympic Games.” The IOC held a conference call Tuesday with sports federations around the world. In the coming days, it will hold talks with with national teams, like Team USA, athlete representatives and the International Paralympic Committee. Tuesday’s announcement came shortly after Tokyo’s Olympic torch relay was being modified in order to limit large gatherings in accordance with guidance issued by the World Health Organization.

Back in October 2009, when fears about the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic were at a crisis point in the U.S., Congress passed emergency legislation to boost the reach of the safety net. The law authorized federal food aid benefits to replace free or reduced-price school lunches for eligible children whose schools were closed for more than five consecutive days. More than 700 schools closed across the U.S. during the course of that crisis, affecting nearly 370,000 students. Then as now, free or reduced-price school meals were a crucial source of food for children in low-income homes. By shifting the delivery of this aid from schools to food stamps through the Pandemic Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or P-SNAP, lawmakers tried to avert a knock-on hunger crisis spurred by the disaster response. In the end, P-SNAP benefits were never used. School closures were brief, not all the schools that closed relied heavily on food stamps, and few districts were aware of P-SNAP’s existence. Now that the nation is facing a much more severe pandemic, however, P-SNAP’s big moment may be at hand. After U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue called on Congress to reboot P-SNAP as part of the government’s unfolding response to the coronavirus crisis, the House passed a bill on Saturday that would do exactly that. But some, including Republicans in the Senate, say the bill doesn’t go far enough. Helping kids get the food that they rely on schools to provide is just one of the fixes that the federal government needs to implement in order to stave off hunger as jobs evaporate, experts say. In the past, the government has taken action to furnish even more food aid in response to economic and public-health disasters. The coronavirus crisis is staggering the nation with both at once. For weeks, people who use the federal government’s regular Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program have been worrying about how the pandemic will affect their access to groceries. Unlike those American households making huge supermarket hauls in order to hunker down for the duration, families who receive monthly financial infusions from SNAP can only buy so much food at a time. Stocking up isn’t really an option, even as state and local authorities urge residents to do just that. “I think, how?” says Angela Caldwell, a resident of Apache, Oklahoma. She receives SNAP aid for her family of four, which is currently five, since her oldest daughter recently moved back in. “If the funds aren’t made available for you [to last] for two or three months, then how are we supposed to do that?” Even under the best of circumstances, SNAP benefits fail to cover the price of meals in 99 percent of U.S. counties. Feeding her three teenagers is hard enough already, Caldwell says, on the $645 she receives each month in food aid. Her options otherwise are limited: There are food pantries, plus a take-what-you-need drop-off outside the local flower shop. She says there’s no way for her to stock up for an extended hibernation. Plus, there are existing hurdles to receiving charity. In Lawton, Oklahoma, Katlynn Carlisle and her extended family rely on food aid through a single SNAP account. She says that some community food pantries require people to show identification and a current utility bill in order to get help, but none of the family members in her house is on the utility bill; they pay the landlord. That’s just one example of the administrative burden that makes it harder for her family members to get food. “We’re just stressing on stocking up on food. That’s our biggest problem right now,” says Carlisle, who at 21 isn’t old enough to apply for SNAP aid on her own. Because of the way the benefits are calculated — by income, family size, and work hours — her household of extended family members receives about $300 per month. “We’re talking about getting some Lysol to disinfect everything and keep everyone inside, but it’s stressful when you’re only getting $300 a month, for a family of eight people.” Coronavirus is heightening many of these longstanding vulnerabilities. Formal and informal safety nets alike are under incredible strain now, and to make sure families don’t go without food, lawmakers need to address both the supply and distribution of aid, says Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Food banks are already seeing a dip in resources and volunteers. Many of the people who staff food pantries are retirees who are especially vulnerable to Covid-19 infections. “You don’t want them on the front lines,” Waxman says. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which the House passed on Saturday and the Senate is currently debating, boosts food aid in several ways. The bill expands support for pregnant women and postpartum mothers under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, known as WIC. The bill also activates the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) to bolster resources at food banks. And it authorizes the USDA to approve P-SNAP or Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) plans set by the states. Yet the response has to go further, according to Kathy Fisher, policy director at the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger. She lists SNAP as the nation’s first defense against hunger, with food banks and charity plugging holes or serving the need for families whose benefits run short. Coronavirus both hampers the ability of local food banks to do this necessary work and greatly expands the number of people who may soon need it. “There’s a whole secondary layer of responders and no one know who will be able to do that stuff and who’s not,” Fisher says. The nation’s food banking network is innovative and familiar with dealing with crises, according to Waxman. The Feeding America network can reach every county in the nation with food and other necessities in a crisis. After the devastating hurricanes of Harvey, Maria, and Irma in 2017, for example, Feeding America backstopped 30 affected food banks to deliver some 100 million pounds of food, water, and emergency supplies. Typically, though, the crisis is a natural disaster that hits a limited area. In those situations, other non-affected food banks, faith groups, and nonprofits can step up to fill the need. There are other things the government can and should try in order to bolster the safety net now. Anything to cut administrative burden — especially work requirements — is a must, Waxman says. As with library access increasingly restricted across the country, whatever the government can do to make information and services available by phone is important, she adds. Another immediate option to boost the reach of food aid would be to authorize online purchases via SNAP nationwide. Alabama, Iowa, New York, Oregon and Washington have an ongoing pilot program that allows SNAP benefit users to spend their food stamps online from a limited number of grocers (Amazon, Walmart, ShopRite, and Wright’s Markets). This would be a big shift for SNAP: Not all states even allow participants to apply for benefits online. Given the disparities in access to the internet, such a program alone wouldn’t support every household in a food desert — but it’s a fix that could expand options for many. “Other than the Great Recession, we haven’t been tested with an across-the-board quick need,” Waxman says. “We certainly saw strategies during the Great Recession that were helpful. We just need to activate them very quickly. I hope we don’t get bogged down in ideological debates.” To that end, the federal government would need to adjust its eligibility criteria to make sure that low-income families don’t suffer. Only last week, the USDA was still pushing forward a rule that would restrict the ability of states to provide waivers for work requirements under SNAP. The rule, which the USDA itself estimated would force some 700,000 people off benefits, was blocked on Friday by a federal judge, who deemed it “arbitrary and capricious.” “Especially now, as a global pandemic poses widespread health risks, guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP is essential,” wrote D.C. District Court Judge Beryl Howell. Those work requirements still stand, however, and while states can continue to ask for waivers for these requirements, not all states currently do. In states that don’t get on board with waivers, workers put out of work by the coronavirus pandemic will have a hard time showing enough hours to meet the threshold. Having so many inscrutable local standards for eligibility is a hurdle to food aid. Right now it’s an open question whether a no-strings-attached check from the Treasury, like the $1,000 suggested by Utah Senator Mitt Romney, will count as income against SNAP aid. “Food security should be at the top of every [coronavirus] briefing,” Waxman says. “If you put some of these things in place nationwide, like the increase in benefits, then you’re dealing with a uniform set of messages, and you don’t have to figure it out based on where you live.” There’s a great deal that the government can do now in order to make it easier for households to apply for, receive and use federal food benefits. Advocates have been calling for some of these reforms for years. Now there’s a very urgent need to make them happen sooner rather than later. “It’s low-income people who have the least margin for error,” Fisher says. “If they have to run to the corner store for food, that’s twice as expensive. There’s not a lot of wiggle room when you’re on a limited budget.”

A global run on the U.S. dollar triggered by the coronavirus pandemic is once again prompting the Federal Reserve to step in as the lender of last resort for investors and companies scrambling for dollars. The Fed enhanced the existing dollar-liquidity swaps it offers foreign central banks and established new ones as part of sweeping emergency measures unleashed to ease a shortage of greenbacks. The idea is to help companies seeking to either raise cash or repay loans and alleviate pressure on currency markets. First used extensively during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, they’re temporary lending facilities that allow central banks around the world to borrow dollars from the Fed in exchange for an equivalent amount of their local currencies. On March 15, the Fed and five major central banks, including those in the euro zone and Japan, said they’d activate the program to ease a squeeze as demand for the dollar surged. They subsequently increased the frequency of seven-day maturity operations to daily from weekly. The Fed also lowered the rate and added a longer maturity. Then it expanded the swap line to nine other central banks, including Australia and Brazil, bringing the total to 14. And then at the end of March it allowed foreign central banks to swap any Treasuries securities they hold for cash.

Scented candles may be all the rage, but the ritualistic nature of incense makes it a better tool for achieving a Zen-like state. At least, that’s the thought behind the sophisticated scents of Cinnamon Projects, created by Andrew Cinnamon and his husband, Charlie Stackhouse. When they were asked by the interiors studio Apparatus to collaborate on a stick to coincide with a furniture release called Interlude, the duo doubled down on the musical theme and conjured the smell of a violin case. The fragrance is a mix of frankincense (to give it leathery notes), iris and tuberose (to reference the silk-velvet lining), and rosin and spruce wood (to mimic the instrument itself). A svelte package holds 25 sticks that have a burn time of 25 to 30 minutes each. THE COMPETITION • Design studio Commune has produced a $32 incense pack with Kyoto-based Keijirou Hayashi, whose family’s craft goes back 180 years. The sandalwood sticks burn quickly without the sometimes overly sweet odor the wood is often chided for. • Beckoning Spring ($52 for 35 sticks) from the 300-year-old Japanese brand Shoyeido is pressed directly into the shape of a stick instead of being formed around a piece of bamboo—giving its combo of clove, patchouli, and camphor more room to shine. • Lisn, founded in 1989 as a Shoyeido offshoot, creates sticks ($54 for 10) that, at less than 3 inches long, are a microdose of bliss. The brand is also collaborating on a collection with the Mitsui hotel in Kyoto, which opens in summer. THE CASE That Nag Champa you burned in college left a persistent aroma for a reason: The sticks are made from bamboo wood. Interlude, on the other hand, is handmade in Japan with charcoal, which allows more of the actual ingredients to get their due. The earthy frankincense is leavened by the floral notes, particularly the tuberose, known for its clean, gardenia-like smell.

The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit to extend a deadline for voter registration and mailing absentee ballots for the state’s April 7 primary in response to the coronavirus outbreak.Wednesday is the deadline for online and mail-in voter registration in Wisconsin, and the lawsuit seeks to extend it to April 3, according to a release. The suit also asks state election officials to allow more time for mailing in absentee ballots while suspending identification requirements to register and request absentee ballots for the duration of the outbreak.“By implementing these measures, the state can ensure that Wisconsinites’ right to vote is not infringed upon during this extraordinary and unprecedented time,” the DNC and state party said.Five states have already delayed their primaries because of the outbreak, and DNC Chairman Tom Perez has urged states that have yet to hold their vote to expand vote-by-mail and absentee voting options.In Ohio, where state officials invoked a health emergency to close the polls on Tuesday, the state Democratic Party has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to prevent the state from setting a new primary date on June 2 and to order that anyone who has not yet voted be allowed to cast an absentee ballot with no in-person voting. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has dropped his longshot bid to challenge President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.

From funding stresses to headaches about trading from home, the Wall Street worry list is a long one right now. One item is creeping up that list fast: Unreliable havens. Stocks tumbled anew on Wednesday as the turmoil sparked by the coronavirus continued to build. The S&P 500 Index slumped more than 5% at the open, almost erasing a bounce from a day earlier as it tracked losses in both Asia and Europe. But the most eye-catching moves were in the bond market. European government obligations including bunds tumbled at the same time as stocks in the region. Treasuries fluctuated, threatening to extend their decline a day after the biggest yield jump for 10-year U.S. bonds since 1982. A similar dynamic took hold earlier in Asia. The synchronized drop is not something that’s supposed to happen, and it’s a threat to classic diversification strategies where bonds are used to hedge stock declines. To add insult to injury, gold -- a haven for centuries -- is also down in Wednesday trading. “The worst outcome at the moment is there’s nowhere to hide -- your gold is falling, your equities are falling, your bonds are falling,” said Klaudius Sobczyk, a fund manager at PEH Wertpapier AG in Frankfurt. “There is no safe haven.” The trigger for the latest synchronicity is government announcements of stimulus measures to fight the outbreak, as investors adjust to the likely flood of new debt issuance and its impact on growth. All the same the bond rout in conjunction with stock declines is one of a series of dislocations sweeping major assets as investors liquidate exposures including bond positions. Illiquidity and extreme positioning make for a dysfunctional market. Just last week, ETFs tracking U.S. large-cap stocks and long-dated bonds saw their sharpest combined loss since TLT was born in 2002 -- another reminder their inverse relationship doesn’t always hold during crises. Recent moves in risk-free assets -- in money and rate markets -- is “puzzling” strategists at Citigroup led by Matt King, citing rising inflation-adjusted yields and falling gold. “Our best guess is that these have been exacerbated by margin calls, by the oil sell-off, and by the unwinding of loss-making positions by risk-parity and other hedge funds and by absolute return funds,” King wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Basically investors have been liquidating positions everywhere, whatever their rationale.” — With assistance by Justina Lee

Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg’s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning. The viral outbreak has pushed Europe across the Rubicon. The EU  shut its external borders, while members erect internal checkpoints. New curfews, lockdowns and more drastic restrictions are announced every day. Budget rules will be ditched, and Angela Merkel flirted with crossing the ultimate German red line by not ruling out  joint debt issuance. These steps eclipse the measures adopted almost a decade ago at the peak of the debt crisis. Back then, the existential threat forced Europe to deepen its integration. The jury is still out on how far and toward which direction the new threat will take the bloc this time.

Earlier this month, as coronavirus infections surged in Seattle, the downtown office building where Lilliana works started to empty out. Employees were heeding the call to work from home to limit the transmission of the disease. But Lilliana had to keep showing up: A day porter for a local property services contractor, she vacuums the floors, empties the trash, and wipes down surfaces at a multi-tenant commercial property. (She asked CityLab not to use her name because she didn’t want to risk losing her job.) Now Lilliana’s job comes with the pressure of protecting others as well as herself from Covid-19. Half a mile from where an Amazon employee tested positive for the virus earlier this month — eliciting a company-wide office shutdown — she isn’t confident that she had the tools to do it. “My supervisor says, ‘Everything is like normal, wear your gloves and wash your hands,’” she said. “But personally, I think that the priority is the tenants. I wish we had more information.” America’s 4.4 million janitors and domestic workers are on the frontlines of the fight to “flatten the curve,” scrubbing down surfaces where pathogens might live. A predominantly immigrant workforce, these workers report to large institutions, third-party service contractors, and domestic labor platforms. Many domestic workers, especially, are self-employed; they’re caring not only for a house but for the elderly or young people inside it. Virtually all of them hustled to meet the booming sanitation demands amid a rapidly evolving pandemic. And now, some of them are feeling the economic burden in a shifting job market. As coronavirus infections lit up communities throughout the U.S., the demand for cleaning workers has grown. Offices, schools, transit systems, malls, restaurants and other businesses are now seeking anti-viral scrub-downs, and help-wanted ads for cleaners are projected to spike 75% in March compared to the same time last year on the jobs platform ZipRecruiter. On Snagajob, another online jobs posting marketplace, cleaning jobs doubled in the last two weeks, as did applicants who said they were looking for cleaning jobs, according Mathieu Stevenson, the company’s CEO. But being a cleaner — and especially a new or inexpert one — comes with risks that this pandemic could magnify. Already these workers handle corrosive chemicals, haul heavy objects, and come into contact with potentially infectious garbage. Now they are contending with the presence of a dangerous coronavirus on the surfaces they’re cleaning, and some say that they aren’t being provided with adequate training or personal protective equipment. Lilliana says she’s been provided with gloves and eye protection, but with N-95 respirators in short supply globally, her crew is working without them. “We’ve gotten nothing,” Lilliana said. She wishes that she and her colleagues had face masks, hand sanitizer, and better health-care resources to protect their own immune systems as their jobs turn into what she describes as “constant disinfection.” Some workers worry that the materials they’re now being asked to use might be risky. Albina Kalabic, a janitor who cleans one of Amazon’s office buildings in Seattle, said that her colleagues experienced skin and eye irritations from a powerful hospital-grade disinfectant sprayed by a special cleaning crew that serviced the property as a precaution. Virex, a cleaning agent that has become the industry’s weapon of choice to fight coronavirus, can also cause rashes and burns. Asked for comment, an Amazon spokesperson stated that products in use contracted janitorial staff are not new and are being mixed and applied in compliance with federal standards. “Safety is a top priority for Amazon, both with our own employees the employees of our service providers, such as janitorial staff,” she said. Meanwhile, as Americans are scrubbing their own kitchen counters and doorknobs, commercial cleaning operations are becoming more labor-intensive. “It used to be that my job was to just clean one floor, and starting this week, it’s going to be double,” said Amir Kalabic, Amina’s husband, who is also a janitor at Amazon. “It’s becoming a quantity job, instead of a quality job.” Some large West Coast employers, including Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, have promised to pay their entire workforce, from janitor to engineers, for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis, regardless of whether or not they’re working. But not all are so lucky. The policy at Alliance Building Services, a contractor that supplies more than 750 janitors to properties around Seattle, is for employees to use regular vacation or sick days in case they fall ill with the novel coronavirus. The company has also forgone extra training or protective equipment for employees. “It’s just a flu — a very contagious, fast-spreading flu — but it’s just a flu, so it’s easy to kill,” said Scott Smith, the principal of the company. In a sense, he’s right, epidemiologists say: Like the coronaviruses that cause the common cold and seasonal influenza, the novel coronavirus that brings on Covid-19 is vulnerable to such standard interventions as soap, water, bleach, UV light, and alcohol-based cleaners. But once the virus gets transmitted, Covid-19 appears to have a far higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu, especially for older people or those with compromised immune systems. Should they contract the virus, lower-income immigrant workers may also be among the most vulnerable populations, because they often struggle to access medical care and public health information in their own language, and may lack the financial resources to stock up on food and medicines. Immigration enforcement agencies have stopped making most arrests during the Covid-19 crisis, in an effort to encourage undocumented people to seek treatment if they need it. The Kalabics and Cepeda have some measure of occupational defense — all three are members of the SEIU, a labor union for service workers across the U.S. But lots of cleaning professionals aren’t. Domestic workers and housekeepers, many of them immigrants and most of them women, are largely self-employed. Some are now being asked to work in potentially high-risk homes with few protections. “These families or homeowners are not putting in their request for a cleaner as, ‘I just recently started having symptoms and I’m staying home because I may have the coronavirus,’” said Rocío Alejandra Ávila, the National Domestic Worker Alliance’s California State Policy Director and Staff Attorney. “They’re in self-quarantine, so they’re all frantic, and they don’t want to do it themselves. But the person coming in is not getting a heads up.” Laws created to keep workers healthy rarely apply to self-employed cleaners who primarily care for private homes; for example, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) excludes them entirely from its protections. Advocates say this exemption is a product of discrimination against the black women who dominated the domestic workforce when many labor laws were first drafted in the 1930s. “There are currently no standards in place to make sure domestic workers aren’t coming to work when it might endanger their health,” said Julie Kashen, the senior policy advisor for the National Domestic Workers Alliance. These gaps became clear during California’s fire season last year, when many housekeepers showed up to clean houses in mandatory evacuation areas. They had been asked to stay to take care of clients’ pets, or were left behind as an oversight — their clients just hadn’t told them to stay home. Advocates are pushing new legislation that would include domestic workers in California’s OSHA protections, says Kimberly Alvarenga, the director of the California Domestic Workers Coalition. Because the legislature has suspended its session amid the Covid-19 emergency, however, a resolution may be far off. If domestic workers get sick, many will also find it harder to take time off, which introduces a risk of infecting the families they care for, or the families they leave at home. Of the 2.5 million domestic workers in the country, 82% do not have sick leave, said Kashen; worker’s compensation coverage is slim, and varies by state, and unemployment insurance is nonexistent. “Domestic workers hold the economy up on a day-to-day basis: They make it so that everybody else gets to go to work,” said Alvarenga. “At this moment, they’re on the front lines of this, in terms of economic impact. And there are no safety nets for them.” Some gig economy platforms that help cleaning workers book jobs are offering additional measures and protections during the Covid-19 emergency. Ariel Rothbard, a spokesperson for TaskRabbit, said that the company has sent emails to all users with WHO’s coronavirus prevention recommendations, and “advised them to prioritize their health, in order to keep our TaskRabbit community safe.” Snagajob has upped its mandatory training for cleaners to include coronavirus precautions, said Stevenson. TaskRabbit and Snagajob are also waiving normal penalties for canceling a job within 24 hours of a booking. Snagajob’s Stevenson said that he also planned to permanently remove the requirement that workers provide a doctor’s note if they’re sick, or risk negative ratings on the app. “This is a group of workers for whom health care is not always readily accessible,” he said; a constant reality that the current crisis only made starker. Stevenson says that they’re looking into providing free weekly coronavirus testing to all workers on the platform, to provide peace of mind to employers and employees. (That could prove difficult, given the current lack of testing availability in the U.S.) Handy, another such platform, did not respond to requests for comment. Self-employed domestic workers are also facing unique financial challenges as coronavirus bears down. For one, most must provide their own cleaning supplies, and as the stakes of disinfection are raised, Ávila says employers have been asking their cleaners for more potent and specific products — yet another added cost they have to take on themselves. Anabel Garcia, a house cleaner and landscaper who lives in Santa Rosa, California, said through a Spanish interpreter that she has entered homes without knowing if they contain sick residents. While only one of her clients has asked for (and provided) extra-strength cleaning supplies, she says that the burden of buying gloves and face masks has fallen on her alone. But that burden may be soon be replaced by another one: Garcia’s jobs for the next week have mostly been canceled. For even as demand for disinfection initially surged, domestic work opportunities are likely to shrink as more people shelter in place, and offices, schools, and large institutional spaces shutter. Cleaners who are part of the Facebook group House Cleaning, Laundry, and More Tips are already reporting waning demand, with clients canceling shifts last-minute for fear of catching the illness or because they are no longer able to afford the service. Some cleaners themselves chose not to show up to a house for fear of being a vector for disease.  “Now that this crisis is happening and hitting everybody, domestic workers and other low wage immigrant workers are going to feel it the worst,” said Alvarenga. “They don’t have anybody to take care of their children, they don’t have the ability to access a lot of the rental assistance programming because of their [immigration] status, and they don’t have access to unemployment insurance.” A special elite of cleaning workers are getting extra training to face the pandemic. Nik Lahiri, the owner of California-based Essel Environmental Engineering and Staffing, has been relying on Craigslist to recruit hundreds of new employees to serve on hazmat crews for the surge in demand for building disinfections that he foresees in the coming months. New hires undergo three to five days of intensive training, and usually come with some previous experience of cleaning up after natural disasters or viral outbreaks. “When the rest of the world is losing their minds, houses and jobs, that’s when people rely on us to come through,” Lahiri said. “It’s our duty to have people ready that are properly trained and aren’t just picked up off the street.” Changes may be coming for some unionized workers. Amid the outbreak, David Huerta, the president of SEIU West, a chapter representing about 23,000 janitors among many other service professionals up and down the West Coast, said that the national organization is currently bargaining with employers and will soon present a list of demands for workers, including access to health care, paid time-off and information, training, and proper safety equipment. “This is going to be a huge challenge, keeping up with every workplace, every property, every apartment complex, everyone,” said Huerta. “We never really realize how important cleaning is until we realize that there’s an epidemic out there that’s just beginning to spread.” And while cleaners themselves are proud to be part of the solution to this public health crisis, they don’t want to be erased, said Cepeda. “We’re trying to keep this virus out of the buildings and keep all the people safe,” she said. “But I’m a human being. We want to feel safe too.”

Glastonbury festival has been postponed until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have said. The music festival, due to celebrate its 50th anniversary this year, is among a long list of high-profile events pushed back or cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Michael and Emily Eavis, the event's organisers, confirmed that tickets for this year would roll over into 2021. A post on Twitter announced the news, saying: "We are so sorry to announce this, but we are going to have to cancel Glastonbury 2020. Tickets for this year will roll over to next year. Full statement below and on our website. Michael & Emily." A statement said: "We are no longer able to spend the next three months with thousands of crew on the farm, helping us with the enormous job of building the infrastructure and attractions needed to welcome more than 200,000 people to a temporary city in the fields." Glastonbury, which draws around 200,000 people to farmland in Somerset, was due to take place from June 24-28. The postponement follows updated guidance from the Government, calling on people to stay away from pubs, clubs and theatres and to avoid all non-essential contacts and travel. Last week, US rapper Kendrick Lamar was announced as the third headliner, joining Taylor Swift and Sir Paul McCartney, with Diana Ross due to play the Sunday legend's slot. Other music acts on the line-up include Dua Lipa, Camila Cabello and Pet Shop Boys, as well as rockers Sam Fender, Blossoms, Haim and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. The Who, Madonna and Miley Cyrus have cancelled live dates due to the Covid-19 outbreak, while festivals such as Coachella and Stagecoach in the US have been postponed or called off. In the UK, Radio 1's Big Weekend is among the other big music events called off by organisers. The festival, which had Biffy Clyro, Harry Styles and Cabello on the line-up, was due to take place in Dundee from May 22-24. In Hollywood, Disney announced it was shutting down production on many of its live-action films, including The Little Mermaid, and the studio also delayed the release of a blockbuster remake of Mulan, which had been due to arrive in UK cinemas on March 27. Other film releases postponed include A Quiet Place II and Fast And Furious 9, as well as the upcoming James Bond movie No Time To Die, which has been pushed back to November, having originally been set to arrive in April.

There’s a rush of interest in handing out  $1,000 to every adult American—or some variant of that gambit—to soften the economic harm of the Covid-19 pandemic. Advocates of showering money on the public include fiscal conservatives such as Senator Mitt Romney, the Utah Republican, and Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist who was a chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush. The Trump administration wants to send out checks soon, possibly in amounts greater than $1,000 each, as part of a stimulus that could total $1.2 trillion. Helicopter money, so called because it seems to fall from the sky, gets a lot of dollars out to a broad swath of the public. (The assumption is that the Federal Reserve won’t counteract the stimulus by sucking the dollars back out of the economy.) In contrast, a payroll tax holiday, which President Trump has  advocated, helps only employed people who incur payroll taxes. But a check from Washington doesn’t work as quickly as a payroll tax cut, which could take effect as early as April 1. Helicopter money is usually done via a tax credit that’s “refundable,” meaning you get it even if you don’t owe income taxes because your income is too low. The credits take time to enact and carry out. “In 2008, legislation approving the stimulus passed in February, while most individuals received checks amounting to $600 (twice that for joint filers) between May and July. In the current environment, a similar timeline of three-to-five months would be far too slow,” economists Carl Riccadonna and Andrew Husby of Bloomberg Economics  wrote on March 13. Average monthly consumer expenditures in the U.S. in 2018 Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics  One problem with both kinds of tax cuts is that they’re too small for people who are in a pickle and too big for those who don’t need help. And the businesses in the most danger will benefit the least. No one’s going to splurge on  restaurants,  airlines, or  hotels just because the government cut them a check. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, says one solution is to beef up and extend unemployment insurance for people working in virus-stricken industries. While that helps the workers, it doesn’t help the companies. One out-of-the-box idea: The federal government could give money directly to companies to make up for lost revenue. In the airline industry, for example, “If demand drops by 80 percent, the government would compensate this missing demand, in effect buying 80 percent of plane tickets and maintaining sales constant,” Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman proposed on March 16 in an article on Pro-Market, a University of Chicago Booth School of Business blog. “Business activity is on hold today,” they write, “but with intravenous cash flow, it can be kept alive until the health crisis is over.” —With Josh Wingrove, Laura Davison, and Saleha Mohsin Read more:  How Covid-19 Affects the U.S. Workforce, by Income and Industry

Former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader Sean Feeney knows it's important to have skin in the game during a crisis. That's why he is offering a share of profits to employees at Misi and Lilia, the restaurants he co-owns with chef Missy Robbins. While staff members are being temporarily let go so they can seek unemployment benefits, those who return when the restaurants are allowed to reopen are eligible for a percentage of the profits, he said on Instagram. Feeney also made a plea that government support businesses hurt by the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, just as banks were helped during the financial crisis. “We can demand that relief comes to our industry the same way it did to the financial industry in 2008 in the form of TARP when I was trading high-yield bonds for a living,'' said Feeney in his post, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. “I saw what that did to save our country, its people and companies on Wall Street. These same mechanisms should be used for all industries at this time again.''

On March 9, as President Donald Trump was downplaying the health risks posed by the coronavirus and  comparing it to the flu in an effort to keep stocks from tumbling, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine was declaring a state of emergency—even though the state had only three confirmed cases at that point—warning Ohioans that more stringent safeguards were on the way. The same day in California, Governor Gavin Newsom was overseeing a plan with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf to disembark, treat, and quarantine passengers from the virus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship. And in Washington, the state with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, Governor Jay Inslee was weighing mandatory limits on public gatherings, after successfully petitioning the legislature for $100 million in emergency funds. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed a stark divide in the U.S. between the state and federal responses to the crisis, with governors stepping into a void left by the sluggish actions and mixed messaging of the federal government. It’s a division that Trump himself has deepened, say local leaders of both parties and political observers—for example, by telling governors on a teleconference that they should try to obtain ventilators and other medical equipment on their own. “Normally, if you’re a governor, you would wait for some lead from the federal government,” says Raphael Sonenshein, a political science professor at California State University at Los Angeles. “You would expect the national government to come in with the big checkbook and the sweeping powers it possesses. When the national government doesn’t play that role, you see governors stepping into the vacuum.” The federal government responded to the outbreak weeks later than other countries, especially in calling for social distancing and making testing available so the spread of the virus can be understood and limited, says Dr. Peter Katona, professor of medicine and public health at the University of California at Los Angeles. States and their leaders have wide latitude to take action during a public-health crisis, and in this instance, they’ve been forced to be especially aggressive, he says. “To be blunt, it’s because the White House really has not been doing things correctly,” Katona says. “The federal government has just been very, very slow in acting on this in an appropriate way.” In early March, much of what the president said about the virus was  contradicted or clarified by other administration officials, including his assertion that the number of cases nationally was declining and that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.” The president unleashed broadsides at press conferences and on Twitter,  calling Inslee “a snake” while defending his administration’s response to the crisis and attacking the news media’s coverage of it. But on March 13 the White House  declared a national emergency, freeing up billions of federal dollars to assist state and local governments. A few days later, Trump seemed to  shift his tone on the virus, calling for people to avoid large gatherings and admitting, “This is a very bad one.” According to polls, Americans view the outbreak and government response through a partisan lens, with most Republicans saying Trump has done a good job handling the crisis, while most Democrats say he hasn’t. Some Republican governors have been slow to respond—possibly, Katona says, because they took their cues from Trump. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, for instance, drew criticism for a March 14 selfie he tweeted and later deleted, showing himself and his children at an Oklahoma City food hall and saying, “It’s packed tonight!” Other Republican governors, including DeWine, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, and Gary Herbert of Utah, have been among those taking the strongest steps to counter the outbreak. DeWine has been more active and forceful than most. A day after his emergency declaration, DeWine recommended that spectators be banned from indoor sporting events—before leagues began canceling games. He set the limit of mass gatherings at 100 when others put the number higher, and he was one of the first governors to close schools, bars, and restaurants. DeWine also supported the state health director ordering the polls closed in the March 17 primary as a health emergency. The governor said all along he based his decisions on science and guidance from a team of health experts, erring on the side of being too aggressive in the name of saving lives. If they have made mistakes, it will be because they “were too cautious,” DeWine told reporters on March 11. “But I don’t think these are mistakes. We’re doing what we have to do.” DeWine’s actions have drawn praise from Democrats, including former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland, who says he disagrees with DeWine on some social issues but thinks he’s handling the crisis well. “He’s providing the kind of leadership that probably we needed at the federal level,” Strickland says. In California, as Newsom declared a state of emergency, moved to limit public gatherings, and tried to obtain more tests to screen for the virus, he worked with Oakland’s Schaaf, a fellow Democrat, to find a place to dock the Grand Princess after other mayors expressed concern that the ship’s passengers might spread the virus to their cities. “We have to not let our fears impede our humanity,” Schaaf said. The plan provided for the ship to dock at an empty industrial berth and most of its California passengers to be quarantined for 14 days at military bases. Others with the disease were treated at local hospitals, and passengers from outside the U.S. took chartered flights back to their home countries. Trump’s criticism of Inslee came after a tweet from the Democratic governor in February in which Inslee said he’d spoken with Vice President Mike Pence—who’s heading the White House coronavirus response—and asked that the administration stick to facts when discussing the crisis. Inslee brushed off Trump’s “snake” insult in an appearance on CBS, praising the help he said Pence and the federal government had given him in battling the contagion. “We are very pleased with the federal government helping us right now,” Inslee said. “I don’t care what Donald Trump thinks of me, and I just kind of ignore it.” The U.S. federalist system of government, intended to allow the national and state governments to share power, is often a source of tension as leaders assert the primacy of federal over state authority on particular issues, or vice versa. The system appears to rule out the sort of unilateral actions taken in response to the coronavirus by countries such as China—which isolated an entire province to fight the outbreak—and France, which imposed a near-total nationwide lockdown. Experts say the limits of U.S. federal power in taking extraordinary steps to deal with a public-health crisis haven’t been thoroughly tested. Other countries’ experience in fighting the outbreak shows that speed matters, with cases of Covid-19 expected to double every several days if there’s no intervention. So states should be taking aggressive actions, says Rajeev Venkayya, who was responsible for the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza under President George W. Bush. When it comes to measures like staying home and closing schools, “we have to do them early and in a coordinated fashion for them to [be] maximally effective, which makes leadership from government critically important,” Venkayya says. Governors acting on their own create a patchwork of safeguards across the U.S. “You’d like to see every state taking some form of action because this is a global problem, and not a problem in one state or one city or one county,” says Katona. New York’s Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency on March 7, and three days later deployed National Guard troops to assist with more than 100 confirmed cases at the time. On March 12, he banned gatherings of more than 500 people. That meant closing down Broadway shows—a $1.8 billion annual industry—as well as museums and other cultural sites. On March 16, Cuomo joined New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, both fellow Democrats, to announce a ban on crowds of more than 50 and ordered closure of bars, movie theaters, restaurants, and gyms. The decision to act jointly came “amid a lack of federal direction,” according to a statement from the governors. Trump fired back at Cuomo after the day’s teleconference, tweeting: “Just had a very good tele-conference with Nations’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to ‘do more.’” Cuomo responded on Twitter: “Happy to do your job, too. Just give me control of the Army Corps of Engineers and I’ll take it from there.”

With America’s coronavirus testing still in shambles, one county in Colorado has decided to take matters into its own hands. Public health officials in San Miguel County have teamed up with a biotech company called United Biomedical Inc. to collect blood samples for a new Covid-19 antibody test and provide free screenings to all 8,200 people in the area. The county is home to Telluride, a small, idyllic ski town normally packed with tourists. Now, though, it has followed many other areas around the country and adopted shelter-in-place procedures to try and limit the spread of the novel coronavirus that has triggered a global pandemic. Residents face a particularly high risk in the remote area, with a large population of seniors, and officials aren’t waiting for federal intervention.

President Donald Trump complained that the coronavirus outbreak “could have been stopped” in China, further escalating his dispute with Beijing as criticism mounts over his own effort to stem the disease’s expansion across the U.S. Trump aired his assessment -- a stark shift from his praise of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s response last month -- at a news conference Thursday to discuss national outbreak-control efforts. The president again characterized the pathogen that causes Covid-19 as a “Chinese virus,” with the term “corona” crossed out with a marker in his prepared remarks and replaced with “Chinese.”

After a halting start, governments and central banks have finally been coming to grips with the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. The Covid-19 disease is more than a health crisis. What seemed like an alarmist scenario a month ago—a  global recession—now appears a certainty. And the extreme measures needed to limit infections may intensify the slump. Maurice Obstfeld, the International Monetary Fund’s former chief economist, says you’d have to be optimistic to believe we’re experiencing something akin to the recession caused by the financial crisis, when global output in 2009 shrank 0.1%, according to IMF data. As governments restrict travel and close restaurants while manufacturers prepare for temporary shutdowns, major economies are now experiencing a “hard stop,” which could inflict a toll that may be closer to the 9% contraction Greece endured at the height of its sovereign debt crisis, he says. “We are seeing a collapse of economic activity as countries try to get a handle on this disease,” Obstfeld says, pointing to the plunge in industrial production and consumption  in China as evidence of what lies ahead for Europe and the U.S. The extent of the damage, he says, will depend in large part on the scope and duration of the outbreak. But a lot relies on governments acting in unison to roll out aggressive measures that ease the pain for big businesses ( think airlines) as well as the little guy (your neighborhood  bartender). At the same time, central banks need to do everything in their power to prevent what began as a health crisis from morphing into a financial meltdown. After some foot-dragging, policymakers in Europe and the U.S. are swinging into action. Central banks have cut rates and enacted measures to ensure stressed markets continue to function. Following a  March 16 videoconference call, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations vowed to do “whatever is necessary” to protect lives as well as livelihoods. The statement echoed former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s 2012 vow, in the throes of the European debt crisis, to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro. But the G-7 declaration, which was replete with grand promises rather than tangible actions, didn’t spark a relief rally the way Draghi’s pledge did. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 13% on March 16, as  U.S. markets recorded their biggest single-day fall since the 1987 crash. That the G-7 statement came just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its  second emergency rate cut in 12 days raises an ominous question: What if this time whatever it takes is not enough? During the global financial crisis, much of the credit for preventing a slip from recession into depression went to the decisive actions of groupings such as the G-7 and G-20, which repeatedly signaled their resolve to eschew protectionism and beggar-thy-neighbor policies like currency devaluations. More than a decade later, it’s plain to see that the bonds among historical allies have been frayed by the trade wars and heightened mistrust—which risks taking the response to the present crisis down a dangerous nationalist path. By calling SARS-CoV-2 a “Chinese virus” and abruptly imposing travel restrictions on visitors from China and Europe, President Trump has further strained those relationships. Chinese officials have complained of unfair discrimination and ordered the  expulsion of American journalists. The Europeans, who were irritated that  Washington hadn’t consulted with them on the travel ban, introduced their  own restrictions a few days later, and a raft of other countries including  Canada have followed suit. Another factor working against a concerted effort is that the U.S.—and Trump, a self-proclaimed anti-globalist—presently holds the rotating presidency of the G-7. It doesn’t help either that Saudi Arabia, which is at the helm of the G-20, has decided to wage a  destabilizing price war against U.S. shale oil producers. “Right now I don’t think—given the Trump presidency—anyone imagines the G-7 or the G-20 as an effective coordinating device for a response to this crisis,” says Adam Tooze, a Columbia University economic historian and the author of Crashed, an account of the 2008 crisis. “The only way to put this is it’s quite disillusioning.”  Data: Compiled by Bloomberg  It’s not just the Americans and the Saudis who could undermine attempts at collective action. In what Obstfeld calls a “Europe First” moment, the European Union recently banned exports of face masks and other protective gear to countries outside the bloc. Although the move was meant to ease the flow of precious supplies within the EU, it was also evidence of something potentially more corrosive. “It’s not surprising that after three years of President Trump tearing down international cooperation the Europeans would not have a lot of trust in any sort of U.S. leadership role or be willing to put their interests at the mercy of international cooperation,” says Obstfeld, who’s now at the University of California at Berkeley. “But it’s really sad, and it doesn’t bode well for the future and trust between countries once we as individual nations get through this panic.” There are signs that such tussling may be only just beginning. Die Welt am Sonntag and other German media reported on May 15 that the Trump administration had sought to acquire a German company developing a coronavirus treatment to secure its sole use for the U.S., prompting an intervention by Berlin. Tooze and others see in that a portent of a bigger fight to come, one that will likely take the trade restrictions from the realm of safety equipment into the far more challenging arena of intellectual property and medicines that pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop. “The major players are acting as if their interests are not aligned,” says Daniel Drezner, a Tufts University political scientist. That is one of the major ways in which this crisis is different from 2008, says Drezner, author of The System Worked: How the World Stopped Another Great Depression. Then, national interests were both interlinked by globalization and aligned in stopping a meltdown of the financial system. The economic model being tested—free-market liberalism—was also not facing the same assault from populist alternatives such as Trump’s “America First” brand of capitalism. Although many expect the current economic shock to be short and sharp, there are also concerns that it may have other, longer-lasting consequences. At the Institute of International Finance, chief economist Robin Brooks and his team have been tracking huge outflows of money from emerging markets that could trigger old-fashioned balance-of-payments crises similar to the ones that engulfed Mexico and most of Asia in the 1990s. Brooks also frets that governments in developed economies are moving too tentatively and on parallel tracks, which will dilute the potency of measures to offset the downturn. “We need with greater urgency globally a fiscal response, and it needs to be coordinated,” he says. “There’s no reasons for delay now. We know this thing is coming, and it is coming hard.” In December 2008 the IMF’s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, pushed for a coordinated global effort by governments to spend an additional 2% of global gross domestic product, or $1.2 trillion, and economists increasingly say something of the same order is needed now. As of March 17 governments had announced stimulus measures adding up to just under $3 trillion, or 3% of global GDP. Included in that total is a $1.3 trillion package proposed by the Trump administration that will still have to get through a divided Congress in an election year. While financial markets have been underwhelmed by the response so far, it’s worth remembering that the U.S. had been in recession for almost a year by the time the G-20 nations convened in Washington in November 2008 to coordinate policies in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. “If we had that amount of time with the coronavirus, we’d feel pretty lucky,” says Tooze. Today, “the sheer pace is staggering.” Obstfeld says the sudden stop in economic activity hitting Europe and the U.S. now looks a lot like an accelerated version of what happens in a classic emerging-market crisis when countries abruptly lose access to capital markets. Which is why he worries the world’s biggest economies may be about to experience a Greece-like shock, with all its consequences, from sharply rising inequality to a realignment of the political order. An inadequate policy response—with less fiscal stimulus than needed and the erection of more barriers to trade—would mean a contraction that could be deeper and longer than the one the U.S. suffered in the Great Recession. An adequate one may mean a rapid recovery and avoiding the economic doldrums that followed the last crisis. “That,” Obstfeld says, “would require a lot more coordination between countries.”

Why is credit under pressure once more? Mainly because the decade since the global financial crisis has not been the “Decade of Deleveraging” that many expected. Banks have delevered since then, but that debt largely has moved to governments and other corporates, both of which are far more heavily levered than they were in 2008. Household debt remains essentially unchanged. That explains why corporate credit is bearing the brunt of concerns this time — even the highest-quality corporate names. The yield spread that companies rated BAA or better by Moody’s must offer compared with Treasuries has shot up in recent days to the highest since 2012.

Brooke Young was driving by the library she manages in Salt Lake City when she saw two teens huddled by the staff door trying to access the building’s free Wi-Fi on their phones. The county, like several others across the U.S., had shut down all public facilities, including libraries, to curb the spread of coronavirus. And Utah Governor Gary Herbet had announced a “soft closure” of all K-12 public schools, with the option for districts to resume class online. But getting online for class will be hard for kids in Young’s Glendale neighborhood, where residents are largely immigrant, of lower income, or part of the refugee community. “We’re in a historically underserved community, and it has the lowest rate of internet-at-home in the city,” she says. Many students would typically do their homework at the library. With libraries closed, both the Wi-Fi inside and the hotspot devices they lend out are no longer available. Tens of millions of public schools students in the U.S. are out of class this week due to the Covid-19 outbreak, according to Education Week. At least 40 states enacted statewide closures, and individual school districts in the remaining states have also announced shutdowns. Most schools are saying they will be closed for at least two weeks; Kansas became the first state to order its schools not to reopen for the remainder of the academic year. For many of the more than 100,000 schools closed, teachers are moving their classes online. But not all students can take advantage because of the lack of technology at home, a disparity known as the homework gap. Some 15% of households with school-age children don’t have internet at home, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2015 census data. And in a separate 2018 survey of 13- to 17-year-olds, 1 in 5 teens told Pew researchers that they often or sometimes can’t complete assignments because they don’t have reliable access to the internet or a computer. Both reports found that affected students are more likely to be from low-income and minority families. Without a sound contingency plan to get all students connected, already-disadvantaged youth will fall even further behind over the next several weeks, says Angela Siefer, executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance. “The inequities in all our education systems are going to be even worse,” she says. “The kids whose families do have internet connection are going to have at least some learning continuing during this period, and the kids who don’t won’t.” It’s not just about taking online classes: With libraries and recreation centers closed, and seating restricted at cafes and restaurants that offer free Wi-Fi, students miss out on a host of online resources that can at least partially help make up for missed school days. The disparity speaks to the larger digital divide in the U.S., the impact of which is now exacerbated by waves of business and public-space closures, and by officials’ urges for residents to stay home. The Federal Communications Commission estimates that 19 million Americans lack fixed broadband access simply because their neighborhoods don’t have the physical infrastructure to connect, though one report argues that because of faulty metrics, the true number may be more than double the official figure. And 2017 data from the Department of Commerce shows that some 22 million households don’t have internet because they can’t afford it or don’t need it. Of those, 6 million households say it’s too expensive, and a quarter of those have school-age children at home. CityLab mapped this lack of internet access by school district, based on 2015 census data: One of the least-connected school districts on this map is the rural Red Mesa Unified District in Arizona, where the majority of students are Native American. More than 80% — nearly 1,700 households — don’t have internet access, according to 2015 census data. But it’s not just a problem for rural communities: In Laredo Independent School District in the city of Laredo, Texas, nearly 14,000 households, or 53%, don’t have internet access. In fact, NDIA estimates that some 15 million Americans without internet access live in urban and suburban communities, making up the majority of the digitally disconnected. And whereas rural communities lack adequate physical infrastructure to access the internet, the challenge among poor urban families is more often broadband adoption. Some families rely only on their smartphones and data plans. “It’s not that the mobile phone is superior; it’s that you have to choose,” Siefer says. “And if your budget is already having a hard time with any service plans, you’re going to choose the one that can go with you.” The 2018 Pew survey found that 1 in 4 teens in households making less than $30,000 don’t have a computer at home. But even one computer may not be enough to be shared among parents and their kids. With shutdowns expected to drag on for weeks, if not months, broadband and telecommunication companies have significantly expanded access to their services as part of the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected Pledge. Both Charter and Comcast are opening up their Wi-Fi hotspots for public use and offering free plans to new customers in low-income households or who live with students. “Kudos to the broadband providers stepping up to help during this time,” FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement, though she urged the agency to go further and make hotspot loans available to all students. Education officials and teachers, meanwhile, are scrambling. Philadelphia announced Wednesday that its school district won’t offer remote learning, with superintendent William R. Hite Jr. specifically citing inequity as the main reason. The majority of the district’s 200,000 public school students come from low-income families. “If that’s not available to all children, we cannot make it available to some,” he said at a news conference. Some districts are better prepared than others to offer distance learning. In Kansas City, Kansas, schools will begin handing out devices acquired from their ongoing partnership with Sprint through its 1 Million Project. “We’re going to doing some bookkeeping, making sure that they’re all charged and ready for pickup,” says superintendent Charles Foust. Families who need internet can also pick up hotspot devices and get free service through the internet provider Spectrum. In South Bend, Indiana, officials are turning 20 unused school buses into traveling hotspots and will send them to more than 30 different sites every day except Sunday. Students can access the Wi-Fi within 300 feet of one — bus drivers will stop near parks and other open spaces — using the Chromebooks schools handed out earlier in the year. Teachers in other cities have sent kids home with packets and workbooks while officials try to procure the necessary devices. In New York City, home to the nation’s largest public school system, 300,000 students lack electronic devices at home. The education department is hoping to purchase and deliver at least 25,000 iPads through a partnership with Apple, while also training its 80,000 teachers on how to make virtual lesson plans. Some districts are still trying to figure out who needs help. The nonprofit Connect For Good provides discounted and sometimes-free refurbished devices to low-income families in Kansas City, Missouri. CEO Tom Esselman says they need to prioritize families with children, but first, they have to figure out who they are. “Not just cities, but also individual school districts and administrators have not taken seriously the issue of how many families are really truly affected by the lack of access,” he says. Currently the Kansas City chapter of NDIA has set up a form on its website asking people to describe what exactly they need. The group Leanlab Education has also sent out a survey tool for schools to start collecting data on things like the number of children, the level of internet access, and the number of devices each family has. The first report with aggregated data is set to come out Monday and will help coalition members like Esselman better coordinate their efforts. Esselman is frustrated that it took a pandemic to expose how critical digital inclusion is when advocates like him have been trying to raise awareness for at least the last five years. “We’ve said from day one that Wi-Fi connectivity should be viewed the same as electricity and running water, but because of the economic and commercial implications, we felt like we were years away from that,” he says. “But, oh boy, this crisis is making it appear now why we might get there sooner than later.” CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the location of the 20 free Wi-Fi buses. It is South Bend, Indiana.

A few years ago, Marc Rosenberg was trying to figure out what to do with his life after a career marketing toys for the likes of Hasbro Inc. He fancied himself an inventor, but of what? Rosenberg discovered just what when he stepped into his daughter’s college dorm and saw her roommates on their beds, typing away on laptops. They barely used their desks because they said they were uncomfortable. An idea was born, and after crowdfunding about $500,000, Rosenberg in 2016 launched the Edge Desk, an adjustable pop-up workspace with cushioned seats that now sells for $400.Almost overnight, the pandemic has created a booming work-from-home economy, and Rosenberg’s business jumped eight-fold in the past few weeks.“It's been crazy,” said Rosenberg, who has just one full-time employee besides himself. “We’re managing the best we can.”

Stephane, a 32-year-old financier in Manhattan, recently updated his Bumble profile to read: “Healthy male with a strong immune system and robust Purell supply.” He got a quick reply from a New York woman, who fired back a private message: “Tell me your secret—how did you get a robust Purell supply? I had to fight a woman at the grocery store for a can of tuna.” While it was good to hear from another human being, Stephane never responded. Because, well, Covid-19. The novel coronavirus that causes the malady has infected more than 200,000 people around the world and ushered in a fraught new era of online dating. Millennials, trapped under indefinite work-from-home policies and banned from bars, are on dating apps—swiping, texting, flirting—more so than before. Active users rose 8% on Bumble during the second week of March in the U.S., according to App Annie, which tracks downloads. The big question is how long that will last now that courting in the real world is basically verboten. Dating apps typically run on a freemium model, providing basic services without charge in the hopes that customers will pay more for extra features, such as unveiling who has swiped right on you or applying more granular filters to narrow the dating pool. As social distancing guidelines are rolled out across the U.S. and Europe, dating apps are betting more people will sign up and pay extra to find love—even if it’s virtual for the time being. The bullish view on Wall Street is that users will be willing to spend more time and money on dating apps because they’ve got nothing better to do. The bearish take is they’ll stop paying for extra services because the thought of being within breathing distance of a stranger is more scary than sexy. This month, Brent Thill, an analyst with Jeffries, cut his annual revenue growth forecast from 16% to 9% for Match Group Inc., which owns some of the most popular dating apps in the world including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge. The shares have fallen 30% over the past month, in line with the S&P 500 Index. “The big challenge right now is, who wants to go on a date with someone they don’t know,” Thill says. “If I was single, I wouldn’t want to date anyone right now.” No one really knows how to responsibly date in a pandemic. Some apps are advising couples to meet in open spaces and avoid any form of physical contact; others are suggesting a safer, more sanitary solution: phone sex. “We know it can be a drag being cooped up inside, but there are lots of other ways to have fun: sexting or phone/video sex are great ways to get hot without getting sick,” the dating app #Open, aimed at couples in open relationships, sent in a message to its 50,000 users on Monday. “This isn’t a good time to be swapping spit.” Last week, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked how daters should respond to the disaster. That question “goes to the heart of the matter,” de Blasio said, adding that people cannot get to a point of hopelessness right now. “I do think it’s fine to have a social life, but you’ve got to exercise some smart rules. If you're sick, don’t go on a date. If the date is sick, don’t go on the date.” He suggested keeping a little more distance and said it would be wise even to refrain from kissing one another on the cheek. On Sunday, physically dating in the Big Apple became near impossible as officials closed down restaurants, bars and movie theaters as well as urging residents to stick to strict social distancing guidelines. “People are feeling isolated, particularly those who are single and can’t go home to their parents and families,” says Jordana Abraham, co-founder of Ship, a dating app that allows friends to swipe on behalf of its users. “They are physically isolated, but not socially isolated.” Ship says group chat messages exploded 60% nationwide in the past week. Group messages first started ramping up in Seattle when social distancing rules were enforced. They skyrocketed in New York shortly after similar rules were put in place—with messages more than doubling in frequency in the past seven days alone. OkCupid has also reported surging engagement and messaging among millennials. People are talking more through the app—and they are talking about coronavirus. OkCupid saw a 188% increase in coronavirus mentions on dating profiles between January and February. People being people, cringeworthy virus pickup lines are starting to proliferate. As in: “Are you the coronavirus? Because you take my breath away.” And random hookups are fast being replaced with weeks-long virtual courting, complete with cootie paranoia and forced chivalry.  You know who’s really gonna suffer during this social distancing? Dudes on dating apps Welcome back to courtship, Brad. Welcome back to talking to a gal for WEEKS prior to meeting.We’re pen pals now, my dude.We bout to get Jane Austen up in here. Now, write me a poem. The coronavirus itself even has a mock dating profile, which tells users its hometown is Wuhan, China—the epicenter of the outbreak—and that its major turn-offs are face masks and doctors. Match hasn’t yet revised its forecasts. The Dallas-based company is monitoring the situation “but can’t comment definitively on what impact we are seeing,” a company spokesperson says. Its star performer, Tinder, is also mum on member activity. However, the app, synonymous with a “hookup culture” on college campuses, is urging users to be cautious. “While we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,” Tinder told to its 5.9 million global subscribers, advising that they wash their hands frequently, carry hand sanitizer, avoid touching their faces and maintain social distance in public. Amsterdam-based The Inner Circle was created for working professionals willing to pay a premium to attend exclusive events, such as cocktail-making classes, jazz nights and ski trips, to meet verified matches. Co-founder Michael Krayenhoff says the virus has presented a wholly unromantic dilemma for the business. “We had to make a decision as a company to cancel all our events and refund everyone,” he says.As the pandemic worsened, Inner Circle members began turning to phone calls and video chats. During the first week of March, they were exchanging phone numbers and sending messages about “FaceTime” and “Skype” about 30% more often than a month earlier. This led the company to actively promote virtual dating ideas like “Self-Isolate and Chill,” a play on “Netflix and chill,” a euphemism for sex. “It’s about two people putting on the same television program at the same time, then calling to talk about it as they watch,” Krayenhoff says. “I think that has something very exciting or romantic to it.” — With assistance by Sarah Syed, and Crystal Kim

In the early days of the U.S.’s coronavirus response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised everyone to steer clear of crowds and wash their hands more, urging “older adults” especially to stock up on food and medicine in case things got worse. The news from China was that Covid-19 had been more fatal among people who had underlying health conditions, and who were over 65 years old. The first wave of public health admonitions emphasized that strict social distancing measures were necessary to protect the vulnerable elderly. But younger people, as is now well known, are hardly immune: Not only can heathy young adults be asymptomatic carriers that become vectors of the virus to parents and grandparents, they can also be victims of it; about a quarter of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Italy are under 50. Still, the lingering presumption that coronavirus is merely a disease of “old” people is having damaging consequences — witness, for example, the extremely poor social distancing adherence among Spring Breakers on the beaches of Florida this week. The calculus of pandemic suppression — and arguably, being a person in the world — means that everyone needs to be looking out for everyone, whether they’re old, young, sick or healthy. So far, the U.S. is failing this test. CityLab spoke with Louise Aronson, the author of Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life, to learn more about how the American relationship to age and aging is affecting the way we’ve understood the Covid-19 crisis, and how to recalibrate. Aronson is also a geriatrician and professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. First, how are you? How is this crisis affecting you and your family? So far so good. It’s just weird, it’s so weird — there’s both no time and more time and then you’re worried, but some things are totally normal. I guess that’s what they mean by unprecedented. Are you going into work at UCSF anymore? Basically they’ve said that everybody that doesn’t need to be in there doing stuff should go home. I am principally an out-patient clinician and I’m also an academic, so I work on a variety of projects. For clinic visits, the good news that came out today was that previously you couldn’t bill for telehealth visits for most patients because Medicare couldn’t cover it, but today they announced they’d cover it. Do you need a physical exam for some things? You do, even in this modern age, so some people may need to be seen, but a decent number of things hopefully we can manage well enough. What you lose sometimes in physical exam you might gain by not having more people not getting sick right now. It’s keeping the most vulnerable patients at home. Public health agencies have recommended extra Covid-19 precautions for “older adults” and people with underlying conditions, who are more susceptible to a serious or fatal case of the virus. But we seem to be seeing a lot of confusion about what that means. Can you help define what people mean when they say “old”? Both now, in the context of dealing with coronavirus, and generally? As I’m sure most people know, this is a hotly debated issue. Among the youngest people, old is anybody over 30, of course, and among the oldest people, old is anyone over 85 or 90. There’s an old joke: “Old age is always 10 years older than I am.” I think a lot of people feel that way throughout the many decades of what I like to call “elderhood.” The way I’ve been thinking about it draws on human biology and changes in our physiology, in our risk factors, in our ability to handle drugs, in our immune systems, as well as by the way societies have legally and socially defined old age. If you go back thousands of years and look at Iran or Egypt or Greece or Rome or China or Japan, “old” always comes in somewhere between the ages of 60 and 70. But if you tell most Americans in their 60s that they’re old, they’re going to say something along the lines of: “I’m still fully functional, etcetera, etcetera.” Being old doesn’t mean you’re not fully functional. It doesn’t say anything about your function! All it speaks to is the number of years you have been alive and your biology. When people who are older — and they are the most likely group to do this, although some younger people do it too — and still functional say, “I’m still functional,” they are inadvertently contributing to the very ageism that leads them to make that denial. What they’re saying is that when they — when we all — become less functional — which happens to anyone who lives into advanced old age, and most of us will — we no longer have value as human beings. We no longer deserve compassion and attention. And I strongly dispute that. I don’t want to make this out like it’s a personal failing of anybody but it’s so universal. It is as universal as ageism itself, which we see in ebbs and flows throughout history and culture. I’m not blaming people, but I do believe we have a moment here. As our population shifts from one with lots of kids, fewer adults and almost no old people to one — barring disaster with this pandemic — that’s fairly equal people in all age groups, we have an opportunity to see old age more realistically. Has that psychological aversion to seeming “old” affected the ways people over 60 have responded to this health crisis? We’re seeing reports of Boomer parents and grandparents refusing to take the social distancing precautions as seriously as some of their kids, for example.  People seem to be doing this for a couple different reasons. Some of them just don’t buy that this is a pandemic. There are certain news outlets and individuals who are perpetuating that myth, or have been. Based on where they get their info, they truly believe this is part of a plot by one party to oust the leader of another. They’re just misinformed — perhaps lethally misinformed, which is tragic. And then there’s the other group, where if you don’t think of yourself as old and the restrictions are for old people, then going out almost proves your point. Although the media is saying it’s “old” people, I know at my medical center it says “anybody age 60 or older.” That’s really based on the data from Wuhan, where we saw as late as January that the rates of death were very, very low in the young but that as your age goes up, so does your chance of dying — dramatically. With case fatalities of .2 to .4% in the young and nearly 15% in over 80-year-olds, the chance of death is around 50 times higher. So the risks are real, and yes if you’re more frail you’re more likely to die. This actually is a teaching moment for geriatrics: In geriatrics we don’t deny that chronological age matters, but we also know that in terms of health risks and health outcomes, that age is one part of a complex formula that also must include your functional abilities, like can you walk a mile, can you go up and down steps, how strong is your grip. We know that these are tremendously strong predictions of health in old people, unlike in adults and kids. A lot of people who think of themselves as healthy have high blood pressure, or have a little bit of heart disease but it doesn’t really influence their everyday life; they’re thinking, well, I’m not like a sick person with heart disease. But if you get the virus, you still have a 68-year-old heart. I think our ageism is such that it’s putting people in a position of feeling the need to prove themselves. It’s almost as if, if they’re not out there doing things, then they’re one of those old people that doesn’t count. We have created that cultural reality, so shame on all of us. On the other side of the spectrum, many younger Americans — at least at the beginning of the crisis — were less cautious. One theory is that they figured they were safe because they had a lower fatality rate. Was our response to this modulated by our perceptions of elderly people? Maybe in some ways. Today I was just tweeting about this headline that said “Not just older people: Younger adults are also getting the coronavirus.” When you say “just” older people, it sounds like, well, it’s just killing old people, they’re all dying anyway. Which isn’t true. These are people working and living lives! We say that the average life expectancy of an American is 79 years — there are huge differences by race and sex, but that’s the average. And if you look at the medians, half of Americans currently live past age 80. Which is a lot. If you’re a pretty healthy 85-year-old woman, chances are you’re going to live another decade. Most people would see an 85-year-old and say, well she’s on her way out anyway. But she had another decade of life. I firmly believe that if we do more planning population-wide — but also are smarter about older people and target them in ways that aren’t just diminishing but are empowering, as we all want to be targeted — maybe we can prevent some of the illness and not get to the point where we have to take these draconian measures. Some of the most shocking reports out of Italy came from hospitals where there weren’t enough ventilators for everyone, so doctors had to start triaging patients — making hard choices about who should get further care and who wouldn’t, based on their condition and often, their age. How do you think U.S. hospitals will approach a situation like this?  We’ve rarely done it, except for in war, and some people would consider it quintessentially un-American. At the same time, we’ve been pretty slow to respond. There were clear messages from the people who can do modeling of epidemics and who understand viruses; the sorts of scientists and experts who have been routinely devalued in recent years. Had we listened to them — and had we still had an office in the federal government that dealt with this, instead of having certain leaders lying about the threat — that action would have made the sort of rationing we consider un-American not necessary. Are there still steps we can take? Yes, and I think a lot of brave leaders are taking steps. We’re all sheltering in place [in San Francisco], and not everybody’s listening to that, but we should all as citizens be doing everything possible. In every family we can probably find people — not just older people — who are at risk. Because once you start devaluing people based on one characteristic, then you have precedent with which to devalue other people. How should we be looking out for our communities right now, regardless of age?  In San Francisco, homelessness is in every single neighborhood now. The income inequality is blatant — and that’s before this. I think there are lots of groups we’re looking at here. There are levels of things you can do: There’s showing support and care, which frankly has been proven to make everybody healthier, strangely. There’s actual practical support, like people in apartment buildings can knock on the door of the older neighbor and say, “Hey can I do anything for you?”  I’m seeing interesting things online about being at stores and finding either poor families or older people who can’t afford their groceries and paying for them — if you can afford to do that, it’s a lovely thing to do. We can keep the social distance and still be helping out. There are coronavirus-care love languages, kind of?  Totally. Think of creative ways to be supportive. There’s pretty good data that people that behave that way are happier than people who are mean. It’s kind of a win-win. Also: If you’re out and about, because you feel that you’re safe to do so, you should be cleaning. Clean door handles! Wash your hands those 20 seconds with hot water and soap! Most of us have someone in our families who is old, and most of us will become old. We are right now creating our futures by our behavior.

At the Watergate club on the Spree, where the old West and East Berlins meet, artists like the four-person band GHEIST and Claptone, who performs in a gold-plated Black Death mask, played to an empty dance floor on Wednesday. Their performance was instead watched by thousands of would-be clubbers logged on to a newly created streaming service, www.unitedwestream.berlin. On the dancefloor in the ‘Watergate’ club, Berlin. Photographer: Carsten Koall/Getty Images The event was the first attempt by Berlin’s famed nightclubs to keep the show going after the German capital’s coronavirus fight brought the shutters down last week on clubs, bars and pubs across the city. “If you’re at home, under quarantine, you’re going to have a little bit of club culture in your living room,” Lutz Leichsenring, a board member for Berlin Clubcommission, an advocacy group for the city’s nightlife, said in an interview. The shutdown threatens the club tourism sector that annually contributes 1.48 billion euros ($1.58 billion) to Berlin’s economy. It also puts at risk the livelihoods of thousands of club employees and artists. For the weeks ahead, the clubs and the Berlin Clubcommission are teaming up with broadcaster ARTE Concert to open their virtual doors daily, offering several hours of live DJ sets, music and performances. Visitors to the site will be asked for a donation and will get a “Virtual Club Ticket.” “Watching the first broadcast gave me hope for the future in what has felt like a hopeless time,” said Ivy Rossiter, a music producer. Income from the streaming will contribute to a relief fund that supports clubs, event organizers and artists, the organizers said. In the first 24 hours, the platform raised 103,139 euros from over 3,000 donors. The closing of the clubs, bars and pubs has left about 9,000 employees, as well as tens of thousands of artists -- singers, DJs, dancers, stand-up comics -- without work and wages. The clampdown was part of a broader plan to limit gatherings that had accelerated the spread of the virus in Germany, which has recorded about 13,900 confirmed cases and 43 deaths. Some of the city’s clubs were linked to confirmed cases of the pathogen. Last week, Berlin health authorities said 17 people who were at the Trompete club later tested positive for the virus, while another venue, Kater Blau, asked those who were there on the first weekend of March to self-isolate themselves after one of their clients was found to have been infected. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel used a rare television address to urge Germans to abide by restrictions bringing social life to a standstill, calling the pandemic the country’s greatest challenge since World War II. “This is serious -- and you need to take it seriously,” she said. “There has been no such challenge to our country since German reunification – no, since World War II.” Despite the streaming service cushioning the blow to the nightclubs’ balance sheets, Leichsenring still expects the temporary shutdown to harm the industry. He called on the state to provide support. “We have to prepare for longer than we expect... We need governmental support, [to avoid] bankruptcy in that time, and to stay liquid,” he said.

Asma Khan spent years working to create a restaurant business staffed by home-taught female chefs that would celebrate the food of her native Kolkata and provide support to immigrant women and their extended families back home. The last thing she expected was for a deadly virus to bring all of her efforts to a shuddering halt.Asma started with dinner parties in 2012, progressed to supperclubs, hosted a residency in a London pub, and finally in 2017 she fulfilled her dream and opened the Darjeeling Express restaurant. She and her staff of 22 (21 of them women) served lunch as usual on Monday before Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should stay away from public gatherings at places such as bars, cafes and restaurants. (Last night, he ordered a shutdown.) She realized right away that she would not be able to avoid closing the business she loved for an uncertain period. The U.K. is following many other countries by encouraging social distancing to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “I saw the writing on the wall,’’ Asma said. ‘‘People were saying they would come to us out of solidarity, but I couldn’t have them coming out of love and then making them sick. I have to contribute to making the city safe. I couldn't let our restaurant be a source of infection or disease.“I have a big responsibility. Our employees are immigrant women. Each is supporting 15-20 people back home — entire families, half a village: Grandparents, children, in-laws.  The children won’t go to school.’’Asma is certainly not alone with all her worries, and now for the hospitality industry there is no clear end in sight. Some restaurants, including Brat and the Tonkotsu ramen chain, are switching to takeaway of home delivery, which is allowed under relaxed government licensing regulations. JKS group is planning to step up its Motu home-delivery business. Brat chef Tomos Parry will prepare dishes for guests to take home along with wine from his wine list, which will be sold at discounted prices.  The government this week announced a £330 billion ($384 billion) package to help businesses, including tax breaks, loans and grants. But the indefinite nature of the shutdown means many restaurants may be hesitant to take on more debt. Last night, the government said it will pay 80 percent of the wages of furloughed workers, up to £2,500 a month. So what happens next for Asma?  It had been difficult to get a table at Darjeeling Express since it featured in a Chef’s Table documentary on Netflix last year, and each lunchtime, there were 95 guests in the 55-seater restaurant off Carnaby Street. “I closed on March 17, which happened to be the third anniversary of my signing the lease for Darjeeling Express,” Asma says. “That was a landmark day for me. It was enormous. I had never before signed a contract in my life. Even my mobile phone was in my husband’s name.”She’s talking tough and plans to re-emerge even stronger. “It is women who will pay the highest price in hospitality, not the arrogant chef,” she says. “I am looking at my options but we will definitely come back. I cried but now I feel like when you reboot your computer. I hope we come back to hospitality kinder. And chefs less arrogant, less angry and less toxic. I hope it will make us all very humble.” Richard Vines is chief food critic at Bloomberg. Follow him on Twitter @richardvines and Instagram @richard.vines.

In normal times, jails and prisons are uniquely well-suited for spreading communicable diseases. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, dozens of cities and counties have worked to reduce the number of inmates cycling in and out. Many plan to release inmates and suspend prosecution for mostly nonviolent crimes. And yet, in places including New Orleans, one of the most heavily incarcerated cities in the world, local prosecutors have refused calls to take the steps that could avert a catastrophe outbreak. The New Orleans district attorney, backed by the city’s mayor and police superintendent, is opposing any blanket policy that would release inmates — even if it would mean mitigating a coronavirus outbreak — arguing in court filings that such a measure could spread the disease to the general public. That view is not shared across many other major cities. In Baltimore, State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has halted prosecutions for all drug, prostitution, and even public urination offenses. “Now is not the time for a piecemeal approach where we go into court and argue one by one for the release of at-risk individuals,” wrote Mosby to her staff, The Baltimore Sun reported. Mosby also joined 30 other state’s attorneys, district attorneys, and attorneys general from jurisdictions across every U.S. region, including Hawaii, in calling for prosecutors to cease indictments and release inmates deemed nonthreatening to society. These include people charged with low-level crimes such as drug offenses, shoplifting, and driving without a license; and many who haven’t yet been convicted of anything. The law enforcement officials signed on to a joint statement laying out rights and responsibilities for people who are in custody. The statement asks that jails stop admitting and detaining people, including immigrants and those who are undocumented, if they don’t pose a “serious risk to the physical safety” of communities. They also are asking that each inmate has access to quality health care and free phone calls to family and counsel, especially for sick and solitary confined.    This is an agenda that most prosecutors can’t adopt on their own. “Every jurisdiction is different in terms of what the prosecutor controls or what the sheriffs or judges control,” said Miriam Krinsky, executive director of the organization Fair and Just Prosecution, which organized the statement. But, Krinsky says, “they are all working with their police chiefs, other criminal justice and public health leaders to navigate through the various categories of crimes and penalties to implement the recommendations that the joint statement raised.” The coalition warns that the chronic overcrowding that regularly takes place in jails, state prisons, and ICE detention centers could lead to a coronavirus outbreak that “would potentially be catastrophic,” given many of these custodial facilities have already failed to contain the spread of less fatal disease outbreaks. If these facilities become breeding grounds for the coronavirus, it will not only impact those incarcerated, but our entire community. Jails and prisons cycle large numbers of people in and out of close, unsanitary quarters on a daily basis. ... People leave immigration detention and return to communities in the US or to vulnerable refugee shelters and encampments along the border. All of these facilities rely on services and support from vendors and medical professionals, employ staff who come and go, and appropriately provide access for legal counsel and family members to visit.   Medical experts have been raising flags about the potential for a prison-based coronavirus catastrophe since the outbreak started. “The way jails and prisons are designed and administered promotes the spread of communicable disease,” former NYC Correctional Health Services chief medical officer Dr. Homer Venters told the Brennan Center for Justice. “Generally speaking, these are unsanitary settings, and there is not ample access to handwashing. Most of the terms that we have learned in the last few days, like social distancing and self-quarantine, are completely not applicable in these settings.” Among the signers of the letter are San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, Durham County (North Carolina) District Attorney Satana Deberry, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. These are mostly prosecutors who’ve made names for themselves by pushing for policies that would reduce arrests and incarceration. However, they don’t represent the only cities adopting decarceration and prosecution-suspending practices. In Brooklyn, District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced that his office will stop prosecuting low-level offenses. Seattle District Attorney Dan Satterberg said on Twitter that he’ll file “only priority in-custody violent crimes” for the next two weeks, after which he would file motions to continue arraignment for other felonies for 30 days.  @emilybazelon For the next two weeks we will file only priority in-custody violent crimes. After that we will file felonies with a motion to continue arraignment for 30 days. This is six weeks of reduced mandatory activity in court.  Then we assess... Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle announced this week that she would begin “to develop a process to release misdemeanor & nonviolent felons,” but only after her primary rival and a slew of criminal justice reform activists pushed her to do so. In Pittsburgh, District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. is acquiescing to demands from the Coalition to Abolish Death By Incarceration and the Abolition Law Center to release certain inmates from the county jail. Meanwhile, local jails in Chicago, Louisville, Austin, Virginia Beach, and Omaha have all begun releasing nonviolent offenders and pre-trial detainees. An even longer list of local and federal court systems have postponed pending trials until further notice. One place that’s not seeing a ton of action is in Mississippi, the site of several uprisings and deaths in recent months for reasons associated with the deplorable conditions of the state’s prison. On March 16, advocates from the Mississippi Prison Reform Coalition, the ACLU of Mississippi, and the Mississippi Center for Justice sent a letter to Governor Reeves imploring him to scale back incarceration and detention activities. “If you have not already, we ask that you immediately reach out to the Mississippi State Department of Health (“MSDH”) to develop plans to address the virus in all Mississippi facilities that house prisoners or detainees, including Mississippi Department of Corrections facilities, county jails, and juvenile detention centers,” reads the letter. “This is an urgent matter. Having an appropriate, evidence-based plan in place can help prevent an outbreak and minimize its impact if one does occur. Not having one may cost lives.” In New Orleans, some inmates have been released on a piecemeal basis, thanks to a campaign led in part by New Orleans’ public defenders. They have been raising money to bail out as many people as possible from jail, which is as much about reducing risks of spreading coronavirus as it is about implementing reforms that they have been working towards for years. They have also been arguing on a case-by-case basis in court that particular defendants should be released due to the coronavirus. But none of these efforts have been sufficient to release as many people as could be released by adopting policy changes like the ones called for in the joint statement — a step Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizaro has been unwilling to take. "It is disheartening that the Orleans Public Defenders would seek to exploit this public health emergency by asking our police and courts to turn a blind eye toward criminal conduct,” New Orleans district attorney spokesman Ken Daley told Nola.com. “We review bond-reduction motions on a case-by-case basis, and oppose them when appropriate in the interest of public safety. This is hardly a time to encourage lawlessness.” Cannizaro’s office has argued in court filings that coronavirus is a reason not to release inmates, because it could perpetuate the disease’s spread to the general public, according to The Lens NOLA. As is the case with all local jails, many of the people sitting in the Orleans Parish Prison haven’t been convicted for any crimes; they are only awaiting a hearing or arraignment. During Hurricane Katrina, inmates were also held in the jail too long, as the disaster worsened, which led to preventable deaths — or rather, mysteriously disappeared prisoners. Speaking with inmates who were trapped there during the floods, the ACLU wrote in a report on the aftermath: “The picture that emerged from all of these accounts was one of widespread chaos, caused in large part by inadequate emergency planning and training by local officials, and of racially motivated hostility on the part of prison officials and blatant disregard for the individuals trapped in the jail.”   The criminal justice systems in New Orleans and Mississippi now have an opportunity to not repeat the mistakes made during Hurricane Katrina. And, they now have political cover from a wider prosecutor community to change their jailing policies.

Elizabeth Holmes and  Sunny Balwani ran Theranos Inc. together as chief executive officer and president, and for a time, as girlfriend and boyfriend.But when they go on trial over criminal charges that the once-promising blood testing startup was a fraud, they will face separate juries.A judge didn’t explain why he severed their trials in a brief order issued late Friday, saying only that he found “good cause” to do so, and that Holmes’ trial will start Aug. 4 as scheduled, while Balwani’s will begin after hers is finished. Since the two former executives were charged in 2018, they have maintained a unified, if sometimes strained, front. Legal experts have said their past romance is probably a  “complicating factor” as they try to avoid being convicted and sent to prison. One possibility for the split is that one defendant is turning on the other, considering testifying against his or her former lover or even cooperating with the prosecution.Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the answer may lie in the dozens of court filings being kept from public view.“The fact that there have been sealed filings and the judge does not specify the basis suggests that there may be sensitive information at issue,” McQuade said. The shielded documents may reveal trade secrets or sensitive information about the defendants such as health or medical issues, she said.

Where Europe leads, others follow -- at least when it comes to the rules of commerce. Why? Because the alternative could be too costly. Companies selling into multiple markets want a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and products, perhaps even more so in a world grappling with the Coronavirus, and that is effectively giving the European Union an edge in setting standards far beyond its borders. Even Brexit-bound Britain and trailblazing California are feeling the Brussels Effect. It’s a term for the influence the EU exerts by shaping rules and technical standards adopted by companies and countries around the world. When YouTube pulls a video rant off its website, it’s using the EU’s definition of hate speech. Timber chopped down in Indonesia, honey harvested in Brazil and the amount of chemicals in Japanese toys all abide by rules set by Brussels. EU antitrust probes into Google’s business are mimicked by India, South Korea and even the U.S. The list goes on. Global companies can’t afford to ignore the terms set by one of their most important markets, says Columbia Law School Professor Anu Bradford who coined the term “Brussels Effect” in an article and a book. If businesses want to avoid producing different versions of the same product for different markets, many will take the EU line for a number of reasons. Legislation from the bloc of 27 nations can prove more flexible than that from other regions as the EU picks up what’s been trialed in its member states, such as privacy tested out in Germany or emissions trading programs in the U.K. European rules also need to be agreed by consensus, allowing a say for companies and consumer or environmental activists. What comes out sets a high standard that firms with global supply chains tend to accept. Pretty much everything. Companies wanting to prove their products use safe chemicals will follow the EU’s REACH rules. African farmers growing food that might be sold to Europe will shun genetically modified crops to comply with EU standards. Trees felled illegally can’t be made into products destined for Europe. Any business that collects and uses data (that’s most of them) knows of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, rules that limit what personal information can be gathered and stored. Looking ahead, energy efficiency and environmental rules to meet EU climate goals may also be adopted by companies and copied by countries across the globe. That’s another matter. Its support of human rights is often ignored and few countries seek to emulate its expensive and generous social security and health systems or high-wage labor market. The euro, overseen by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, has never seriously challenged the dollar as the world’s benchmark currency and the EU’s struggle to contain its own financial and debt crises have eroded its role as a global economic power. Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King argued in a Bloomberg Opinion column that for U.K. banks the partnership with the U.S. may offer a better hope for regulation than tying London to an EU model. The Brussels Effect, a variation of the ‘California Effect’ phenomenon also described in academic research, didn’t come about by design but the EU’s executive, the European Commission, is happy to show it off. It invites overseas officials to see how it works and explain its policies, for example telling China how Europe tries to keep state subsidies in check. Lobbyists from companies and governments around the world maintain offices in the Belgian capital. The U.K.’s move to quit the EU was partly predicated on the desire to make its own rules. Yet, according to Bradford, the country is likely to remain hooked into EU regulations as its businesses push for alignment to allow them to sell into the European market of 450 million people. When it comes to internal EU debate, Britain’s disappearance will eliminate a pro-market voice that often countered French and German pushes for greater regulation and intervention. The EU isn’t leading the rule-making in every area, particularly emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence that are dominated by Chinese and American companies. Weary about the excesses such industries may bring, EU tech czar Margrethe Vestager aims to ensure technology deployed in Europe is transparent and has human oversight, likely meaning more stringent guidelines than in many other regions. — With assistance by Jonathan Stearns, and Nikos Chrysoloras

It followed Trump’s comments Friday that the drug, hydroxychloroquine, was a “game changer,” that “we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” and noting that patients could get it from their doctor.

Economic crises, in general, are terrible for mental health. This one, however, goes far beyond numbers in a portfolio, darkening every transaction, both social and commercial. How we behave as consumers may be fundamentally changed long after this pandemic is a dark footnote of history.   “It’s akin to a PTSD,” said Ilene Green, a Manhattan clinical psychologist. “All of this will be on people’s minds in really quiet ways indefinitely. …I would not call it a mental illness, but this kind of thing does get folded into the psyche.” The best recent proxy, according to Green, may be the 9/11 attacks. She never goes through Grand Central Station anymore without scanning for danger, triangulating escape routes. Days ago, Green did a similar sort of morbid calculus to return a sweater. It doesn’t help that we will likely be negotiating more than a year of gray area from the end of self-containment to the relative all-clear of a coronavirus vaccine. Those will be fraught months in which every transaction—every restaurant meal, every vacation—will be cranked through a cost-benefit analysis, overlaid and weighted by the news of the moment, namely fatality and infection rates. Consider the sharing economy. While health officials urge millions of people to shut their homes to friends and family, lending one’s car to a stranger is still fair game (at least it was when I wrote this). The country’s burgeoning car-sharing platforms are limping along, albeit with assurances that vehicles are cleaner than ever. Zipcar, a unit of Avis Budget Group, said it has upgraded its cleaning process with antiviral solutions and is waiving cancellation fees. It’s also encouraging members with Covid-19 symptoms to contact the company, so it can isolate and sanitize any vehicles they used, before returning them to the fleet.  Turo, a San Francisco-based platform with 10 million members, has also implemented a no-penalty cancellation policy and provided users tips for disinfecting cars and swapping keys remotely.  The average American sedan or SUV, it turns out, is often a speeding petri dish of sorts. Vehicles swapped widely among users aren’t unlike restaurant tables, albeit with more nooks and crannies to cultivate germs. Not surprisingly, car-sharing demand has declined, according to Turo, though the company would not quantify the dropoff. Car-swap platforms benefits from so-called network effects: the more people who use them, they better they work (and the more richly they are valued by investors like IAC and Softbank). In just a few weeks, however, Coronavirus has reversed and weaponized that chummy feedback loop. Volume, scale, foot traffic—all dirty words at the moment. The equation is similar across the sharing economy, from the dress racks of Rent-the-Runway to the scooter fleets of San Francisco. Green, the therapist, says consumers are running risk algorithms in their heads at a frenzied pace, a pace that will be hard to slow. “Are people going to want to come to my Airbnb? Do I want people in my Airbnb?” she wonders. “I do think it’s going to have an impact on how willing we are to engage in the same sorts of social transactions we did before.” How quickly companies recover from Covid-19 will have much to do with how carefully they consider the post-traumatic stress of pandemic consumers. If you run a retail empire, for example, you would be advised to build a system for remote and "no-contact" pick up. If you run a car dealership, the whole transaction ought to be iPhone-able, from the financing to the curbside delivery. And if you run an airline, a theater chain or cruise fleet (God help you), a sanitizing strategy will be as critical as a smooth supply chain. We might not be traveling much for the next 18 months, but when we do, germ-free seats will be fetching a premium. That's just logistics and marketing, however. There will be a human capital component as well. Imagine a restaurant staffed entirely by Covid-19 survivors? Stranger things have happened; they’re happening every day, unfortunately.

Michael Berkowitz is a student of disaster, and a guru on how cities weather them. As the former executive director of the nonprofit consultancy 100 Resilient Cities, and now as founding principal at the similar Resilient Cities Catalyst, he has worked with dozens of local governments around the world to plan for hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, mass shootings, disease outbreaks, and other social shocks. Now, as a global catastrophe unfolds in the form of coronavirus, Berkowitz is trying to think ahead as he shelters at home in New York City. He’s looking for signs of how communities will survive the aftermath, as well as for opportunities to strengthen resilience now in the face of social and economic disruption. “The key is to think about linking various objectives together,” he said over the phone. “How can one particular intervention succeed in strengthening a city across a lot of different areas?” Berkowitz, who also served as deputy commissioner of New York City’s office of emergency management in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks and has done global risk management at Deutsche Bank, spoke with CityLab over the phone on Thursday. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. First: Define this concept of resilience in cities. What is it, and how do you build it? Urban resilience is the ability or capacity of a city to survive and thrive in face of disaster, any kind of disaster. It turns out that the capacities that cities — or states, or nations — need to survive and thrive in the face of all these different threats are pretty broad. It includes good infrastructure that promotes mobility and sustainable transportation. It’s also cohesive communities where neighbors check in on neighbors. It’s a diverse economy with a strong middle-class jobs base. It’s good governance with multiple stakeholders at a decision-making table. All of those things help communities overcome whatever the next crisis might be. To build resilience, the trick is linking different goals together. When you’re doing economic development, how can you also make yourself better protected for floods? When thinking about mobility, how can you increase biodiversity or reduce exposure to extreme heat? When thinking about governance and community engagement, how do you build trust and confidence in elected officials so that in crisis situations people listen to and follow the advice of elected leaders? What are the best examples of good governance you’ve seen so far in the coronavirus response? Well, one observation is how governors seem to be having much more impact than mayors during this pandemic, because they’ve been able to have a remit across various administrative boundaries. In New York state, the first cluster of case was north of the city in Westchester County, in New Rochelle. By now, obviously New York  [City] has seen the majority of cases. But while the mayor has been important spokesperson, the governor has wielded much more power and has been able to unify the state around Westchester. It’s been the state that has acted more quickly around testing, setting up the drive-through testing sites, including one in the city. So that’s been in an interesting example of state authority, which I never would have expected, by the way. In old East Coast cities, with their protocols and histories and legal authorities for public health emergencies because they dealt with smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, and other plagues of old, I would have thought that mayors would be in the driver’s seat with this. But it feels like governors are leading the charge. How would you rate the resilience that the U.S. has shown so far? Michael Kimmelman wrote this week in the New York Times about how pandemics are anti-urban because the things we value in cities, like density and connection, are the things that are least desirable during a pandemic. That’s true — but only in the response phase, which we’re in right now. The things that we need now are very particular: It’s public health surveillance and testing capacity. It’s the ability to innovate and produce therapies, whether those are vaccines or anti-viral treatments. It’s surge capacities in hospitals, whether it’s ventilators and masks or more beds. It’s the ability of the public to absorb and adhere to advice that we’re getting about protective measures to take. But one way or another, in the coming months or later, we will break the chain of transmission. Then we’re going to look up and have our small businesses hurting or closed, our most poor and vulnerable people suffering, lots of people in the middle class who didn’t have safety nets or full-time employment looking for work, the stigmatization of various ethnic, racial, or demographic groups who we think might have done things to put us at risk — all of this is going to stress our society so significantly. And when that next phase hits, that’s when we’ll see benefits of urban resilience — of neighbors checking in on each other, strong neighborhood institutions, diverse economies, good governance. Those things will pay off in ways that will let us rebound from this situation and hopefully let us build stronger communities. The thing is, we’re still so early in. A week of staying at home feels like forever, but we’re just at the very tip of the iceberg in many ways. We’ll see which communities are more or less resilient in the next months and years to come. What kinds of actions should communities take now to prepare for that second phase?   I feel like it’s a little premature, since we’re still on a steep upslope of trying to flatten the curve and making sure our hospitals and medical system can make it through intact. But I will say that when Congress starts talking about delivering aid to people, institutions, and businesses, that’s when you start to think about the resilience-building opportunities we might have. What might some of those opportunities be? In the U.S., there is probably going to be a jobs stimulus. And that will likely come with a lot of new infrastructure that we build. That gives us this incredible opportunity to build more resilient infrastructure and to engage communities as we do it, since they’re going to live with it for generations. We should also talk about climate change mitigation and adaptation, because if we’re potentially going to get a whole new generation of infrastructure because of this pandemic, then we have to do it better than last generation. Meaning, like, no highways that segregate communities from economic centers. We should also set new goals — we have the tools to think about economic development, public health, biodiversity, and flood control all at once. We have the beginnings of examples of what those types of projects look like, such as building large swaths of green infrastructure to protect cities from sea level rise, like the BIG U in Manhattan. There will also be any number of different aid packages to promote economic development and community institutions, in and out of government. With the right guidelines we can make sure those investments work for multiple benefits. One example is how, after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans saw itself as overexposed to climate change as well as the petrochemical industry. Over the past five years, the city has tried to incubate a water management sector that the city could then export as a core competency, in the way the Dutch do. So how do cities diversify economies in a way that solves multiple goals, whether it’s racial justice or mobility or health. One last idea — I haven’t thought too much about this yet, but it seems like we’re going to bail out the airline industry. Well, what if we took some of that money and dedicated it to high-speed rail? That’d be huge. And what if we used the bailout money to push airlines towards carbon neutrality sooner than they’d normally get there? They are a huge contributor to the climate crisis. What a good idea. Congress, are you listening? Right. I just know [U.S. Secretary of the Treasury] Steve Mnuchin is going to read this, call me up, and just get on this. These are large-scale changes to improve the resiliency of infrastructure and economies — what about for individuals or neighborhoods? What can they do to strengthen our collective recovery? Even action at really small scales can feel great and start to set an example of what is possible. You can imagine that if we’re in for a prolonged economic downturn our most vulnerable communities will feel that first and in the most pronounced ways. When these shelter-in-place or social distancing restrictions are lifted, people are going to come out in a real big way. Wouldn’t it be great if we harnessed some of that to improve what our streetscapes look like, in a way that adds greenery and reduces trash and just really improves things? One example: There is great evidence about how taking small abandoned parcels of land and rejuvenating them can transform a community. A study published in JAMA from a couple of years ago surveyed people living near vacant lots that were cleaned up and replanted for just a really small amount of money. The researchers found a 41.5% reduction in people who reported feeling depressed, and a 62.8% reduction in poor mental health. That’s astounding. Small interventions can work. People taking initiative to make things better will be appreciated when this thing lifts.   What are some other ways that individuals can help? I do think that there is a lot to be said for patronizing local businesses and being intentional about that. Right now, Amazon is doing really well, and while I don’t want to talk badly about them, it’s worth thinking about the local small- and medium-sized enterprises which will be hard hit. And there might be some innovative ways to help them. At 100 Resilient Cities, we had a really interesting platform partner called Colu, a cryptocurrency [Ed: Colu no longer operates as a cryptocurrency] that lets you set up a local virtual currency as a way to reward different kinds of behavior. It let people get credits by participating in civic activities or volunteer work, and then they could spend that through local institutions. It was deployed in Tel Aviv. When we’re talking about depressed economies, that could be an interesting way of kickstarting things like civic participation, which I think will be really important. It’s obviously true that more crises await us in the future — but one thing that is especially hard about this one is the total lack of certainty about the duration. It’s hard to imagine the future because the end of coronavirus — with all of its human, social, emotional, and economic costs — is so difficult to make out. As someone who has a lot of experience with disaster, do you have any advice or remarks for those of us struggling with the scale and uncertainty of all this? I haven’t been through a big public health emergency like this before, but yes, I’d say a couple of things. One, we know there can be an amazing bond among people who survive things like this together. The sociologist Enrico Quarantelli found that in disasters and immediately after there is a lot of good will and community spirit. As many of us are seeing now and hearing anecdotally, people are smiling more and helping each other. This sense that we’ll get through this together is really important. I’d also say that, again, I do think we’re going to have an amazing opportunity to transform ourselves, our communities, and our economies with all the stimulus that is likely coming. But ironically, and painfully, we might be least prepared to do that. In most disasters I’ve seen, which have been physical, there is just not the ability to think strategically in that way. Too often after a hurricane or a big earthquake, where communities have a real opportunity to think more holistically about how to rebuild, they just can’t — it’s just human to just put things back like they were and not make them better. In Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, or in Christchurch following their big earthquake, and in New Orleans after Katrina — in all of those cases, initially there was not the bandwidth to think about things more strategically until like five years down the line. Initially, there are just too many people hurting. So that will be a big question. Will we have the strategic gumption to make things better? That is the $1 trillion question right now for our leaders. So let me go back to a smaller scale. How can individuals prepare to hold their elected officials accountable to that kind of change? After this crisis in particular, where transmission is person-to-person and your neighbors are potentially the ones getting you sick, it will be important not to just retreat behind our screens and phones. We know that cities with the strongest and most robust civic networks pull through the best in disaster — the more you know your neighbors and understand your community boards and really can get engaged, the stronger and more resilient you are. If we can get engaged with each other, we can be more prepared for the next thing that is coming. Thinking really intentionally about how to build more resiliency with every intervention we take is going to be critical to taking this crisis and turning it into an opportunity. Just because we’re focused rightly on this incredible thing does not mean there are not more crises waiting for us. Because, look, hurricane season starts in June.

The OriginIn late March 2009 the H1N1 virus—aka swine flu—first appeared in California. Within a month the first Americans began to die from the virus. In June the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had declared it a pandemic. As the death toll mounted, companies scrambled to come up with a vaccine. By early fall, it was ready. The SuitDr. Richard Daines, a former New York state health commissioner, ordered every health-care worker to be vaccinated against the virus. If they didn’t do so by Nov. 30, they could be fired. The New York State Public Employees Federation and three nurses led by Lorna Patterson, an emergency room nurse at the Albany Medical Center, sued Daines, claiming he’d exceeded his authority in issuing his order. Besides, Patterson said at a news conference, “it takes away from our freedom of choice.” The RulingOn Oct. 16, to the surprise of many, acting Justice Thomas McNamara of the New York State Supreme Court issued a stay, which prevented Daines’s mandate from going into effect. One argument that appeared to sway the judge was that the vaccine had been raced into production without proper testing. The nurses, their lawyer said after the stay was issued, “feel very strongly that they are being set up to be guinea pigs.” The OutcomeThe case never did get to trial. A few weeks later, New York Governor David Paterson suspended the mandatory vaccinations. The reason? A shortage of vaccines. The federal government was able to supply only one-fifth of the vaccines it had promised. In the end, swine flu made 60 million Americans sick; there were 273,000 hospitalizations and 12,400 deaths. But because this decade-old case was never resolved, we still don’t know whether a state official can mandate citizens to be vaccinated. With the  anti-vax movement being what it is, you can rest assured we’ll see more cases like this one as soon as a vaccine for the new coronavirus becomes available.  • That didn’t take long: Among the 2,421 people stranded on the Grand Princess off the coast of California after the coronavirus swept through the ship, a half-dozen have already  sued Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. More lawsuits are sure to come.  • The Theranos angle: On March 9, Fortress Investment Group LLC sued BioMérieux SA, which is working on a Covid-19 vaccine, claiming patents it bought from Theranos were being violated. BioMérieux denied the allegation. After a backlash, Fortress said it would offer royalty-free licenses. So Theranos’s technology isn’t worthless after all. Nocera is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. Read more:  This Famous AIDS Researcher Is Racing to Find a Coronavirus Treatment

One morning last week, I woke up to see videos of my friends in New York City, France and Italy serving their voluntary and mandated coronavirus quarantines at home. Meanwhile, in Singapore, I watched my brother — someone suffering from kidney disease and diabetes — head out the door to work at a Nike retail store at Vivocity, one of the biggest shopping malls in Singapore. I returned to Singapore from New York City on March 10, not to flee Covid-19, but only because I had the flight booked three months prior. This was before cities like New York plunged into lockdown as the first U.S. cases of the disease began spreading. Now I’m reading about panic shopping, eerily empty streets, mass unemployment, and grave fears about ill patients poised to overwhelm an unprepared American health care system. In Singapore, I’ve been feeling like I’m living in an alternate reality from the rest of the world. On a recent grocery run, store aisles were full and it did not look like anyone was stockpiling, only buying what they need for the next couple of days. McDonalds was crowded with schoolchildren studying and playing with their phones. (Schools are not closed here.) Inside the mall, a Muji sale drew a large crowd and long lines. The trains were packed with workers in office attire. Outside, the hawker centers were full of elderly people drinking coffee and chit-chatting about their families or weather. I asked my brother if he thought it was dangerous to go to work at the mall, or if he was scared of touching people’s feet all day and sizing them up for shoes. “No, not at all,” he told me. “At work we have to take our temperature twice a day, so it’s safe.” “You can still have coronavirus even without a fever,” I said. He shrugged. A friend asked me to go to a movie with him and a few other people last week. “Are you scared of coronavirus, or have you been going out as usual?” I asked, genuinely curious. “No,” he said. “The panic buying, stocking up on masks and toilet paper, all that, it’s over. We got through it in January. Life has to go on.” He’s been going out clubbing two or three times a week now. He showed me photos — the club was popping. I wondered: Is this what the normalcy on the other side of the coronavirus crisis looks like? Singapore was among the first places outside China to experience the outbreak: It recorded its first case of Covid-19 back in January 23, on the same day that Chinese authorities locked down the city of Wuhan. Singapore soon had the second-highest number of cases of Covid-19 after China, attributed in large part to travelers from China coming to Singapore over the Lunar New Year. But since then, this densely populated city-state of 5.8 million people has been able to keep its numbers down with some success while other countries —  South Korea, Iran, and then Italy — surged ahead. Singapore’s health system — aided by the city-state’s well-known regime of technological surveillance — responded swiftly and aggressively: Hospitals started redividing teams and had wards emptied out to make space for pneumonia cases, as well as for non-pneumonia patients with travel to China, in case they were infected as well. By testing all pneumonias as well as coughs and fevers, officials were able to pick up and track community transmissions quickly. Temperature screening was rapidly rolled out at the airport, entrances to office buildings, schools and workplaces. Singapore also doggedly traced and tested suspected cases, put all close contacts of a confirmed case under home quarantine, plotted clusters of infection and then made this information transparent and accessible to the public. Confirmed cases have their age, gender, address and places they visited listed on the Ministry of Health’s website. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and a special ministerial task force focused on Covid-19 frequently share videos and social media updates about their interventions, explaining any new risks and reassuring people that they are prepared, that citizens do not have to stockpile or plan for a lockdown, and to only buy what they need. Those measures have succeeded in keeping the rate of local transmission low — only between 5 to 15 cases each day are from contracting the virus locally — and Singapore’s aggressive response was praised by the World Health Organization for its “all of society, all-government approach.” And while Europe and the United States have clamped down borders, canceled events, and closed offices, restaurants and other public spaces, the Singapore government has managed to maintain a strong sense of normalcy amid the pandemic. Large gatherings, senior-centric activities and after-school events may be canceled and social-distancing regulations limiting seating are in effect, but people still go out to movies and restaurants. Some firms might ask their Singaporean employees to work from home, but many workers still go to their offices every day. The government has reminded us to only wear masks if we are unwell. To my surprise, Singapore has managed to keep a lid on community transmission without relying on broad testing, as South Korea has done. Their approach was to focus on vulnerable populations and those who were ill, so that hospitals are not overwhelmed by suspected cases. After arriving from New York, I called my neighborhood polyclinic — governmental community clinics — to ask if I could get swabbed just in case I was an asymptomatic carrier. I learned that polyclinics would send people with a history of travel to high-risk regions and respiratory symptoms to get tested. But the United States was not part of the list at that time, and I did not have respiratory symptoms, so I was told I would not be tested. (On March 19, the U.S. was added to that list of high-risk regions.) But as the disease spreads in Europe and the U.S., Singapore is now looking at stricter approach. In the past several days, more new cases began emerging, including a new high of 54 on March 23. About 80% of these new Covid-19 infections were imported, largely from Singaporean residents and long-term pass holders returning from abroad. Singapore also reported its first two deaths attributed to the virus. On March 18, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force to tackle the virus, announced an expansion of the Stay-Home Notice, which mandates that travelers and returning residents must remain inside a local residence or hotel for 14 days. Once only for those coming from virus hotspots, it will now apply to all inbound passengers to Singapore, regardless of country of departure. Unlike the voluntary shelter-in-place requests issued by other U.S. states and countries, Singapore’s system is rigorously enforced with phone calls, random home visits, and technology. Those under Stay-Home Notice are texted several times a day, for example, so that they can check in via GPS to confirm their whereabouts. Wong also said that the city was tightening its social distancing rules, putting a 250-person cap on large gatherings and mandating one-meter spaces between restaurant diners and event attendees. And as of Monday, March 23, all short term visitors will also not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. “We have to do more stringent measures,” he said in a press conference, “and it cannot just be business as usual.” Meanwhile, neighboring Malaysia is enforcing a nationwide movement control order from March 18 to 31 to ban Malaysians from traveling abroad, halt mass gatherings, restrict foreigners coming in and shut down all schools. Manila is shutting down transportation links in and out of the city. Still, the updated health regulations in Singapore don’t suggest everyone self-quarantine or stay indoors, the way that many cities in Europe, the United States and our neighboring countries are doing. And over the weekend after the new rules were announced, life seemed minimally affected. For now, at least, I still have my feet in two worlds; seeing friends in America and Europe put their daily lives on hold while outside my condominium window, families are swimming together, children are playing in the playground and office workers are returning home. Have Singaporeans become a little too confident that they’re protected from the spread of the virus? When I asked Nur Atiqa Asri, a Singaporean urban planner currently residing in Brooklyn, about conditions here, she was shocked to see crowds of people walking around in Singapore. “I totally understand that Singapore has some of the best health care in the world, but Singaporeans are also some of the most mobile residents of the world,” she said. “So even if they’re not contracting the virus at home, there are others who are getting it elsewhere. I worry more about the older segments of the population, people who are around my parents’ age that are still warming up to the idea that they need to take extra precautions — definitely driven by complacency and overconfidence in Singapore’s systems.” The difference was also jarring for Xi Jie Ng, a Singaporean artist in residence at UMass-Dartmouth who recently chose to return to Singapore. “Having just come from the U.S., where my community is taking this very seriously because their government has failed them, where my friends are self-quarantining and maintaining six-feet distance if out for walks, it feels dissonant for my currently high-alert system to see people out here,” said Ng. “Our cases are definitely going to rise, because people flying home to the comfort of ‘best-in-the-world’ Singapore are spreading it if they don’t home-quarantine first.” Ng self-quarantined when she arrived, and overall, she still has a lot of confidence that Singapore can continue to suppress the outbreak. “Here the palm trees are swaying and the birds are chirping, a la tropical paradise — a paradise that can manage the coronavirus,” she said. “I guess if we can be a little more careful while being grateful for our health care system and fast-acting government, we’ll be all right.”

Some of Canada’s largest banks are revising down their growth forecasts once again as industry shutdowns and layoffs suggest the recession will be deeper than originally expected. The nation’s economy is likely to shrink by somewhere between 10% and 24% in the second quarter on an annualized basis, the latest forecasts show. That would mark the largest quarterly decline since at least the early 1960s, when comparable data began.

The exploration and production company’s long-term default rating was cut three levels to BB+ and may be downgraded further, Fitch said in a statement late Friday. Fitch is the second credit rater to downgrade Occidental, following an earlier ratings action by Moody’s Investors Service, officially making it a fallen angel. Its $35.2 billion of debt will leave investment-grade indexes at the end of the month, and it will be the largest high-yield issuer.

The Federal Reserve is wading into the $3.9 trillion municipal-bond market. But the central bank still has more levers it could pull in the asset class that’s been stung with the worst monthly rout on record. Last week, the Fed expanded its emergency lending program to provide liquidity to money market funds so it would include purchases of short-term municipal bonds, and on Monday, it tacked on support for variable-rate demand notes. Despite the rare intervention, the chorus of calls for more help is getting louder. In the last week, lawmakers, state officials and lobbying groups have all advocated for the unusual move of the central bank buying municipals, at least temporarily.

The novel coronavirus pandemic is testing the residential-solar sector, which had forecast strong growth this year but hasn’t faced a recession since it reached the American mainstream. Its key challenges are similar to those facing many other industries: how to close sales, complete installations, and convince homeowners to add solar panels during a period of unexpected and mounting economic uncertainty. But for some residential-solar companies, the biggest test may be how to reorient their marketing programs—which, new-fangled though the industry may be, still relies on old-fashioned door-to-door sales. “Until people feel safe again, door-to-door sales will be hit,” says Tara Narayanan, a solar analyst at BloombergNEF. “Installations will slow as well. I’m skeptical homeowners will have construction crews over during a time of social distancing.”

The stock market and volatility are in the midst of an unprecedented synchronized swoon.The S&P 500 Index has fallen more than 7% over the past two sessions while the Cboe Volatility Index, a measure of how much that benchmark gauge is expected to move over the next 30 days, tumbled by more than 10 points. Before this, there had never been a combination of a two-day equity drop of at least 5% and a VIX retreat of at least 5 points. The dual declines could be a function of a market normalizing after high-profile blowups of short volatility bets, less demand to roll hedges after a major option expiry, or simple exhaustion. Record-setting levels of market fear aren’t easily sustained, and the drop in volatility expectations signals the most frenzied days of selling may be behind us.

ICU beds and ventilators shouldn’t be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Health-care workers should get priority. Patients with a better chance of recovery should get access to limited life-saving equipment over those who are sicker. Those and other guidelines were released Monday by a group of global medical experts and bioethicists, aiming to provide a dispassionate framework for decision making as some hospitals face a surge of patients suffering severe infections from the new coronavirus. The report’s departure point is grim: Rationing of life-saving equipment will be necessary in some places, in spite of hospitals’ and authorities’ best efforts to boost intensive-care units and ventilators. In other areas, rationing of life-saving care is already under way.

The devaluation of the Nigerian naira will put pressure on the assets of lenders struggling to raise asset quality to the regulatory threshold, according to Moody’s Investors Services. Africa’s largest oil producer on March 20 devalued by 4% the local unit versus the dollar, a move that will cause concern for Nigerian banks’ credit book and capital metrics “as they have a high proportion of foreign-currency denominated loans,” Peter Mushangwe, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service said in emailed response to questions on Monday.

Economists say the U.S. is entering a sharp recession, with some projecting gross domestic product is headed for its worst drop in quarterly records back to 1947. Containing the outbreak has forced the world’s largest economy to a sudden stop, shuttering businesses that are in turn cutting millions of jobs. GDP estimates range widely, but most economists expect a severe second-quarter drop will be followed by a rebound in the second half of the year as the pandemic abates.

At the Belén migrant shelter in the southern Mexican city of Tapachula it’s afternoon recess – one of the two times each day that residents are allowed out of the facility’s front doors. An 18-year-old asylum-seeker from Honduras, who asked to be called John, sits in the sun on a boulder, a face mask slung around his neck. A few miles south, Mexico’s river border with Guatemala – which John crossed last month after fleeing his infamously violent hometown San Pedro Sula – is now fenced off due to the coronavirus pandemic. Guatemalan soldiers in face masks guard the bridge. John received his own mask from shelter staff and, along with other inhabitants, has been instructed to wash his hands regularly, stay clean and inform officials of any Covid-19 symptoms. But social distancing is impossible in this overcrowded facility. Belén’s official capacity is 130, but as of June 2019 some 325 people were bunking in the Catholic-run shelter, according to a study by the International Organization of Migration. Residents share fifteen showers between them, sleep together in dorms and eat communal meals – a nightmare scenario for infection control. Last week shelter director César Augusto Cañaveral Pérez announced Belén would close its doors to new residents to try to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. But John has bigger concerns than catching the disease. “I’m more afraid of returning to Honduras,” he says. Tapachula, in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, is the first stop for most migrants who journey north through Central America. Historically this quiet, sweltering border city of 350,000, hemmed in by rainforests and mountain coffee plantations, was merely a waystation – a place people stayed for a day or two before continuing onward to the U.S. border. Now, due to increasingly severe immigration and refugee policies in both the U.S. and Mexico, migrants are getting stuck here. As Covid-19 spreads into Mexico, these most vulnerable of Tapachula residents could swiftly be facing a health emergency. Mexico recorded its first coronavirus death on March 18 and as of March 22, federal officials reported 316 confirmed and 794 suspected Covid-19 cases nationwide. But testing rates remain low, and the Mexican government's response to the global outbreak has been criticized as insufficient. While some cities and states have closed schools and limited public gatherings, no national-level travel restrictions are yet in place. “This is a virus that doesn’t discriminate,” says Sibylla Brodzinsky, a spokesperson for the United Nations’ refugee agency in Mexico, which partners with shelters in Tapachula to provide services to refugees and asylum seekers. “Anywhere where people are living in close quarters is a concern for us.” Last year, 70,600 people filed for asylum in Tapachula, up from 30,000 in 2018. While their claims are processed, they must remain in Chiapas – Mexico’s poorest state, which has among the lowest per capita health expenditure in the country. During this legal process, which can take two to six months, asylum-seekers live in overflowing shelters, cramped rented rooms, or on the street. Many are already in poor health when they arrive to Tapachula. “[Migrants] are people with scarce resources, exposed to long trips, exhausting days and extreme temperatures,” says Alberto Cabezas, national communications head for the Organization of International Migration in Mexico. “All of these factors undermine health.” Andrés Ramírez, who leads the Mexican Commission for Assistance to Refugees (COMAR), says he is working overtime to keep Tapachula safe for both his staff and the asylum-seekers they serve. Last week his office submitted a hastily prepared evaluation of COMAR’s daily interactions with migrants to national health officials to obtain guidance on how to keep processing asylum applications through the coronavirus pandemic. As of March 18, all migrants who enter COMAR facilities receive written and verbal information about preventing the spread of the disease. “Often this population doesn’t have, as many other people do, access to means of information where they can learn about necessary precautions related to coronavirus,” Ramírez says. Sandi Raymond, a Haitian who earns a meager living braiding hair in Tapachula’s main square, says she knows to wash her hands before she eats, but she had also heard from “people on the street” the incorrect advice that lemon juice would kill coronavirus. No one from the city has approached her with health information, Raymond says. Dr. Gabriel Ocampo González, director of health and hygiene in Tapachula, said the city is taking preventative measures. Interviewed in his office on March 11, the day the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, Ocampo González said coronavirus had not yet arrived in Tapachula but that every migrant shelter, detention center and hospital had hand sanitizer at the entrance, had sufficient hand-washing facilities, and was attentive to symptoms. “It will get here, unfortunately,” Ocampo González said. Dr. Rosa Maria del Angel, an infectious disease expert at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies at Mexico’s National Polytechnic Institute, worries the country’s already strained public clinics and hospitals will struggle to cope with the global pandemic that’s now creeping into Mexico. “It is difficult for Mexico’s health system to take care of sick migrants, especially considering that it will also be receiving Mexican patients with respiratory disease,” she said via email. To discourage the spread of the virus, March 23 has been declared a “National Day of Healthy Distance” in Mexico to discourage the spread of the virus. For migrants in Tapachula, however, distance often proves unattainable. Pierre Tchiballe, an asylum-seeker who recently arrived from Haiti, cannot afford rent in the city, so he’s relying on friends for shelter. With refuges like Belén locking down against coronavirus, finding more permanent housing is harder than ever for Tapachula’s migrants. Tchiballe says the fear of catching coronavirus makes his already precarious situation even worse. “If one day I discover I have corona, I have no one here in Tapachula,” Tchiballe says.

We’ve seen some frightening headlines about how much the U.S. economy could shrink in the April through June quarter because of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example: “Coronavirus will send US GDP down a startling 13%: Deutsche Bank predicts.” That headline is easy to misinterpret. If you’re just tuning into economics journalism, you might assume that Deutsche Bank is predicting that U.S. economic output will be 13% smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. But that’s not what the bank is forecasting. As the body of the story explains, 13% is the predicted annual rate of decline—that is, how much the economy would shrink over a full year if it kept shrinking for four straight quarters as quickly as it’s expected to in the second quarter. Deutsche Bank doesn’t think the contraction will continue at that pace. In fact, it’s looking for a second-half rebound.  You can do a little math to figure out how much the economy would have to shrink from the first quarter to the second quarter to produce a 13% annual rate of decline. The answer is 3.4%. Still a lot, but not quite as shocking. Space is at a premium in headlines, so headline writers often (usually?) leave out “annual rate,” saving that information for the story. If you read a lot of economics news, you’re used to the convention. But many people who are focusing on economic news for the first time because of the pandemic-induced recession could be mystified. (Math detour here: Because of compounding, the quarterly change is not exactly a quarter of the annual change. The difference is easier to see with unrealistically big changes. An annual rate of decline of 80% in the second quarter—perish the thought—implies a one-quarter output decline of 33.1%. Conversely, an annual rate of increase of 80% in the second quarter implies a one-quarter output increase of 15.8%.) Actually, it’s not just the annual rate that Wall Street economists forecast, but the seasonally adjusted annual rate. This factors in predictable fluctuations, such as the increase in retail sales during the Christmas shopping season, to get at the underlying growth trend. And, of course, all predictions of gross domestic product strip out the effects of inflation. If you didn’t do that, you couldn’t tell whether reported growth was caused by an increase in the volume of production or an increase in prices. You wouldn’t need to adjust for seasonality or for the annual rate if you just reported how big you expect the economy to be in, say, the second quarter of 2020, vs. the second quarter of 2019. That’s how China, for one, officially reports its GDP. But that approach fuzzes up what’s happening now. For example, China is finishing up an awful first quarter, but output doesn’t look so weak when compared with a year earlier because there’d been decent growth until the Covid-19 outbreak. If this is too much to digest, just remember that when economists and headline writers talk about economic growth rates, they’re almost certainly citing a number that’s a bit imaginary: the growth that would occur if the quarterly rate of change continued for an entire year. Which it almost certainly won’t.

Even the man who calls himself “MLPGuy” is now forecasting the end of funds dedicated to the unique corporate structure known as the master limited partnership. At one time, MLPs were a preferred strategy for oil and gas pipeline companies seeking to secure certain tax advantages. But those advantages were weakened by the federal government in 2018, causing many energy companies to abandon the structure. Now, the toxic combination of an oil price war and the Covid-19 pandemic is colliding with stress among the funds that hold MLPs, forcing them to join a selling spree that has caused pipeline partnerships to get hit even harder than other energy stocks.

Six workers wearing hazmat suits, full face respirators, and two layers of gloves jumped out of a truck and prepared to enter a small office building at 9 p.m. one evening in mid-March. Bill Ciaccio, a 40-year-old operations manager for biohazard cleanup company Aftermath Services LLC, had gotten a call about a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus a few hours earlier. The business, hoping it wouldn’t have to cease operations for too long, needed its offices disinfected right away. Ciaccio first advised the client on how to prepare: Clear out all employees and wait a few hours to let any airborne particles settle. Then Aftermath’s crew arrived with a custom mix of disinfectants and red biohazard bags. “We set up zones,” Ciaccio says. “The control zone is the area being disinfected, the buffer zone is the entryway. Then there is the clean zone,” he says, where workers carefully peel off their gear and put the red bags into cardboard boxes. By 4:30 a.m. the squad had disinfected the entire space. Biohazard remediation work is exploding as the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S. reached almost 50,000 as of March 24, accounting for 615 deaths. Globally, the outbreak has expanded to more than 399,000 cases in 166 countries. The pandemic is keeping companies such as Aftermath busy 24/7; its caseload has grown to about 50 confirmed Covid-19 cleanups a day. The wave began earlier this month when businesses wanted preventive cleanings amid a shortage of tests to know if employees had the virus. Aftermath says the overall U.S. market for biohazard cleanup services, between $700 million and $800 million in 2019, is expected to more than double this year. “It’s crazy, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Aftermath Chief Executive Officer Doug Berto said in a March 13 interview. The current outbreak is far more extreme, he says, than the pandemic that inspired the company’s founding in the 1990s—the AIDS crisis. Fortune 50 companies have called on Aurora, Ill.-based Aftermath, covering a range of industries, from sports franchises to food service and restaurants. Municipal buildings, police departments, and other public service agencies are also among Aftermath’s clients, which Berto declined to name. Responding  to emergency cleanups requires skilled people—second responders who work closely with law enforcement—protective supplies, and extreme caution. Workers, Ciaccio says, are putting themselves “in harm’s way on a daily basis.” As demand is growing, so too is the company. Aftermath, which has around 275 employees in 50 locations and 100 mobile units, recently increased its staff by 15%. Another provider, New Jersey-based ACV Enviro, has also seen demand spike. “Originally it was transportation hubs, then next was a lot of the large utility companies,” says Donna Miller, vice president for health and safety, describing the rush of service requests. ACV has about 650 to 700 trained field staff, and Miller says that number could triple in the coming months. The cleanup costs can add up. Aftermath’s hourly rates range from $750 to $1,000 for a team of three to four people, or anywhere from $1 to $10 per square foot. With an estimated 71 billion square feet of commercial real estate in the U.S., the price of disinfecting businesses could eat up almost all of the $850 billion in financial assistance for businesses, cities and states now being weighed by the Senate, part of a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan. That’s if institutions clean only once. The rapidly spreading disease suggests some businesses will require more than one cleanup. Businesses that close down could forgo such services and expense. The figure doesn’t include waste disposal costs. Those services, which are typically outsourced, add 20% to 35% to the total cost of any cleanup, Berto estimated. But there are ways to mitigate the burden. Ciaccio says that with large sites, internal video footage can be used to track where coronavirus-infected employees have been and to target specific areas for cleaning. That can “save work when you have a million square feet.” The cleanup team also interviews people to try to narrow down hot zones.  One challenge for companies like Aftermath and ACV is how best to dispose of the waste from cleanup sites. Treating it like regular trash would save costs but raises big safety issues.  The company is looking for clarity on the issue, to be decided between the Centers for Disease Control and OSHA. The agencies did not have immediate responses when contacted for comment about their guidelines. Stericycle Inc., an Illinois-based company that disposes of medical waste, says it hasn’t seen an increase in Covid-19 waste yet, partly because hospitals have put elective surgeries on hold. That’s also partly due to the nature of the disease: “This isn’t the type of virus that’s creating waste from patients themselves,” says Selin Hoboy, Stericycle’s vice president for legislative and regulatory affairs. “There’s not a lot of blood or bodily fluids being generated like we saw with Ebola. It’s mostly personal protective equipment.” Coronavirus waste goes through the company’s autoclaves, or steam-cleaning sites, and most of it is later buried in landfills. Only some waste containers are sturdy enough to be recycled. “The way this thing is spreading is truly like wildfire, and we need to take every action to prevent the spread from happening,” says Vikas Chopra, marketing director at Aftermath. “We want to do our part to flatten the curve.”

Quarantine apartments in Zurich, Zug and Lucerne are available for about 200 Swiss francs to 800 Swiss francs ($822) a day, Alexander Hübner, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Le Bijou Hotel & Resort Management AG, said in an interview. Hübner said Le Bijou has also partnered with a private Swiss health-care service to offer guests twice daily nurse visits for an additional 800 francs a day or even an in-room virus test for 500 francs. The business hasn’t provided any tests yet, he said. Since launching last week, the company has recorded five bookings for the new Covid-19 service. Le Bijou has 42 units altogether, and about half are occupied by guests at the moment, he said. All units are able to operate without staff, including for check in, so clients have the option to remain fully isolated. “They don’t need to shake hands with anyone,” Hübner said. Like most service industries, hotels have been devastated by government-ordered shutdowns of restaurants, tourist activities and large gatherings. Hübner said he started the Covid-19 service as a way to continue generating income during the crisis.

Since the 1970s, the United States has relied on one primary strategy to deal with poverty, pollution, and various other social problems and challenges: quarantine. We have carved up cities and communities with spatial barricades, built fortified enclaves for the affluent, and pursued solutions that relied on segregating the haves from the problems of the have-nots. Now comes the coronavirus, a crisis that refuses to be contained by the barriers we’ve built. (Indeed, because of its connection to international airline travel, it alighted in the booming global cities first.) In a nation that has learned to solve problems by trying to isolate them in space, how can we come together to defeat this virus? To find an answer, we have to look back and understand how we got to this point. In the early 1960s, the dominant approaches to solving the challenges of the moment were grand, public, collective. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson put forth a vision of what the United States could become. In 1964, Johnson told graduates of the University of Michigan, “in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.” But just a few years later, this vision had faded. A horrific war in Vietnam raged on. Pollution was turning skies hazy and making rivers toxic. Violent crime rose sharply in major cities, and riots tore through hundreds of cities from 1965 to 1968. Steady jobs disappeared, the gap between the rich and the poor widened, and poverty and desperation became more visible on city streets. We had two choices, as a nation. One option was to pursue the vision Johnson had presented that day in Ann Arbor, and the kind of wide-reaching proposals put forth in documents like the Kerner Commission Report of 1968: We could make enormous investments to reduce inequality and build thriving cities, and come together to solve the challenges of urban decay, concentrated poverty, economic dislocation, segregation, pollution, violence, and racial injustice. Instead, the United States made a different choice. Americans—particularly white Americans, economic elites and their political representatives—no longer considered making massive investments to confront the problems of the cities. Instead of taking bold steps to reckon with entrenched racial inequality, they asked how to maintain racial separation in increasingly diverse urban areas. Sidestepping the problems of joblessness and deep poverty, they sought ways to preserve economic advantage in a time of rising inequality and state retrenchment. During the Great Depression and World War II, the challenges of the moment were met with bold, national plans of action. But from the 1970s onward, America’s major crises and challenges have largely been met with a response driven by the goals of avoidance and separation. Instead of collective movements and public investment, we have tried to carve up space and quarantine social problems, to allow the most advantaged segments of the population to isolate themselves from those problems, and to restrict who can access areas of opportunity. To deal with the most pressing challenges we face, we have created an elaborate system of barricades in space. Our spatial barricades have come in many different forms over the years. In the early 20th century, Jim Crow laws, racial zoning ordinances, and redlined (and yellow-lined) neighborhoods were used to create rigid boundaries in space that maintained racial separation; in the postwar era, interstate highways and urban renewal projects accomplished the same feat. Today’s forms have shifted. We have converted an age-old barricade, the prison cell, and made it a core institution in our society, locking up millions of Americans, disproportionately young men of color, behind the bars of state and federal prison cells. And we continue to find new ways to divide up and fortify our communities. In cities like Atlanta , for example, groups of neighbors near the city’s border have created their own governments, forming an administrative barrier between them and the city next door. In new municipalities like Sandy Springs, Georgia, affluent residents no longer needed to share their tax dollars with the rest of the city. Nearby, new cities are still forming and residents are still voting to reject the expansion of rail lines in an effort to maintain separation between the city and the surrounding areas. Other barriers are more literal: Hidden Hills, California, a small bloc of land just west of Los Angeles that was incorporated as an independent city back in 1961, now sits behind gates that protect its wealthy residents. When fires raged outside Los Angeles in November 2018, two famous homeowners, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, decided not to rely on public resources and instead called on private firefighters to protect their property and their neighborhood behind the gates. That’s an extreme example of a nationwide phenomenon. Every inch of American soil is demarcated with political, administrative, and physical barricades erected to hoard resources, to quarantine social problems, to restrict access to advantaged spaces, and to preserve and reproduce social inequalities. As trust in the federal government has fallen rapidly over time, we have become a nation that has been taught to respond to great challenges by avoiding them, rather than bringing people together and working toward a solution. This approach has meant that the most pressing challenges facing us have gone unaddressed, the burdens of our national problems have been shifted toward the most disadvantaged, and inequality has continued to grow. Can the crisis we now face be any different? Why would we come together to solve this challenge of a new pandemic virus, when we’ve been conditioned to avoid the major problems that have arisen over the past half century? The map of confirmed cases reveals a sobering answer: A spatial solution to Covid-19 is not possible. The virus is everywhere, or will be soon, directly affecting the lives of every American. The disease has demolished spatial barricades and party lines; it may force us to come together. We have seen signs of this reluctant and fitful cooperation already, as the initial relief legislation put forth in the House generated more expressions of bipartisan goodwill than any piece of legislation in recent memory. (The Senate, so far, is a different story.). The good news is that we have evidence from national efforts to deal with crises like the threat of terror and the financial meltdown of 2008 to suggest that it’s still possible for the United States to come together and respond to national challenges, even if those responses are slow, imperfect or incomplete. But we can only do so when the problem transcends the barricades we’ve erected for decades to reinforce American inequality. This, clearly, is that kind of problem. If we can muster the collective investment needed to fight back against Covid-19, perhaps it will provide a reminder of a basic fact about our species: Our fates are intimately connected. Once coronavirus stops spreading, we will face a global recession, extreme inequality, and the ongoing existential threat of climate change. We have become a nation that responds to these kinds of challenges by giving people the chance to separate themselves from the problem. This virus should show us there’s an alternative way to solve the challenges that face us, collectively.

After a weekend barrage of social media posts documenting sanitizer shortages and soap aisle raids across America’s supermarkets, Melissa Hanesworth and Tara Engel felt they had to act. The two women also knew they were in a position to do something: They had jobs in manufacturing and public affairs at the New York-based North American division of Pernod Ricard SA, the $35 billion French spirits empire behind Absolut vodka and Jameson Irish whiskey. On March 16 they came up with a proposal to retool the corporation’s distilleries for something the country was in dire need of—industrial quantities of hand gel, a cleanser broadly sold out across the country since the outbreak of Covid-19, the disease caused by the  novel coronavirus. They took their idea to Pernod Ricard’s regional head, Ann Mukherjee, who immediately signed off and began supervising a bat-out-of-hell turnaround. Within 48 hours, Hanesworth and Engel had placed a bulk order of chemicals and worked with the White House coronavirus task force to obtain clearance from regulators to begin manufacture. By March 20, Pernod Ricard’s facility in Fort Smith, Ark., where it makes Malibu coconut rum and Seagram’s gin, had produced 1,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. By the next day, President Trump was lauding the company at a news conference as a shining example of corporations stepping up to the challenge of fighting the global pandemic. “These two women were the two absolute drivers of what made this thing happen here,” Mukherjee says of Pernod Ricard’s public health project. “I say to everyone on my team that a time of crisis is not what builds your character, it’s what reveals it. To see everyone step up the way they are—my breath has been taken away.” The distiller’s effort comes as businesses the world over rethink their day-to-day operations so they can help governments fight the coronavirus, which has killed more than 15,000 people globally out of more than 355,000 confirmed infections. Major corporations are heeding the call to address civic need at the fastest pace since World War II, when carmakers such as Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors began producing airplanes and aircraft parts, along with trucks, tanks, marine diesels, guns, and shells. While industry champions were idolized during that period, Big Business nowadays is viewed with suspicion. Yet the speed of its actions amid the global virus crisis could ultimately prove one of the most important factors in fighting the pandemic and help recast its public image. In the U.S., 3M Co. is doubling its production of N95 respirator masks to an annual rate of 2 billion and Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk is holding conversations with Medtronic Inc. about “ state-of-the-art ventilators.” H&M, the mass-market clothier, is adapting its production lines to supply more surgical garments. In the U.K., Smiths Group Plc has ramped up the manufacture of its own medical ventilators, which are in short supply, and has made the intellectual property to produce them available to other companies; the government has asked engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and McLaren Automotive to help build them. In China, the country that first reported the outbreak, Foxconn Technology Group, a supplier of iPhone components to Apple Inc., has refitted production lines to manufacture surgical masks. Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH is distributing 40 million of those to French workers and producing hand sanitizer at its Dior and Givenchy perfume plants. The German government has asked the country’s automakers to manufacture medical equipment, people familiar with the matter have said, and a spokesman for Volkswagen AG said the company has forged an international task force to explore other options. On March 21, Google launched a website dedicated to information about Covid-19 a week after Trump touted the company’s help in the fight against the pandemic. Pernod Ricard’s production of hand gel comes as a wave of beverage-alcohol companies moonlight to fill cleansing-alcohol needs. An increasing number of distilleries, from small-batch whiskey upstarts across mainland U.S. to rum giant Bacardi in Puerto Rico, are racing to supply a product that’s long been the preserve of Dettol, made by Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc in the U.K., and Purell, which is a product of Gojo Industries of Akron, Ohio. Brewers such as Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch InBev NV have also started producing sanitizer, and Scotland’s BrewDog has unveiled slickly branded BrewGel, which will be donated to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary intensive care unit. The American Craft Spirits Association said 3 in 4 of its distillery members are now producing alcohol for use as disinfectant. On March 16, Pernod Ricard’s head of communications, Olivier Cavil, walked into his local drugstore in Champagne, the French region that produces the sparkling wine of the same name, and—not knowing whom to ask—told a pharmacist he wanted to provide 70,000 liters of raw alcohol to manufacture hand sanitizer. She connected Cavil to Laboratoire Cooper, which supplies three-quarters of the cleansing gel to French pharmacies. It accepted the donation. By April, Laboratoire Cooper expects to be manufacturing 1.8 million bottles of 5 centiliter doses. In the U.S., Pernod Ricard expects to produce about 4,000 gallons of hand sanitizer at its Fort Smith facility according to a recipe of denatured raw alcohol, glycerin, and hydrogen peroxide provided by the World Health Organization. The gel will also be made at the company’s bourbon and rye distilleries in Kentucky, Texas, and West Virginia. All of it will be donated to the White House task force to be redistributed to hospitals and wherever else it’s most needed. “We worked very directly with the top of the house at lightning speed,” Mukherjee says. “This is a great example of government bodies and private companies coming together and really doing what’s right at a time of crisis.” Read more:  Disinfectant Manufacturers Scramble to Meet Explosive Demand

If we’re going to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, then let’s do it in a way that shakes up the status quo. This is the message that a group of U.S. economists, professors, and veterans of the last financial crisis sent in a letter to Congress yesterday asking for “green stimulus” legislation to jump-start the economy in a way that controls for climate change and poverty.    They are asking for a $2 trillion commitment for programs that will create living-wage jobs, amped-up public health and housing sectors, and a pivot away from a fossil-fuels-based energy frame. Under their plan, the stimulus would automatically renew every year at 4 percent of GDP, or $850 billion annually, as well as give the public more of a voice in whether — and how — large-scale corporations would get bailouts. For now, the coalition recognizes that the focus should be on stopping the spread of coronavirus and mitigating all related health risks. “However, we can do all the preparatory work now to make green projects are ‘shovel ready,’” the group said in its open letter published on Medium.com. Legislative action and planning work now “can ensure that physical projects can commence as soon as it is feasible to restart major in-person work across the economy.” Congress is already deep in the throes of constructing a large economic recovery bill, to help workers losing income and businesses and governments losing revenue due to the novel coronavirus crisis. But the U.S. Senate is stuck in a debate between Republicans who want to dedicate a quarter of its $1.8 trillion stimulus plan to bailing out corporations, and Democrats who want to ensure strict transparency and oversight over how that $500 billion corporate bailout would be registered. Congressional Democrats are also making their own demands, like making airlines that receive federal funding assistance agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent, and making corporations pay a $15 minimum wage to its workers. The Green Stimulus asks Congress to push for even more to guarantee that workers are protected and businesses can operate sustainably to ward off climate change catastrophes, especially in a coronavirus-crippled economy. The authors of the proposal are focused more on the long-term recovery — similar to the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act stimulus passed by the Obama administration that followed the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act bailout of the Bush administration.   In fact, many of the authors of the Green Stimulus letter either worked on the 2009 ARRA legislation or are now working on Green New Deal legislative proposals, and in some cases both. And yes, much of the Green Stimulus package mirrors the Green New Deal. The Green Stimulus architects are operating under guidelines set by a coalition of climate and environmental justice organizations called the “Five Principles for Just Covid-19 Relief and Stimulus:” prioritize public health; provide direct economic relief to families; relieve workers rather than corporate executives; protect elections and democratic processes; and, make a “down payment on a regenerative economy.” The last principle is what the Green Stimulus seeks to represent. “As policymakers take steps to ensure immediate relief and long-term recovery, it is imperative that they consider the interrelated crises of wealth inequality, racism, and ecological decline, which were in place long before Covid-19, and now risk being intensified,” according to the principles. CityLab spoke with J. Mijin Cha, an author of the Green Stimulus, senior fellow at Data for Progress, and assistant professor of urban and environmental policy at Occidental College. Much of her scholarship has been on the transition to a low-carbon economy, and how to fairly prepare fossil fuel workers and the unemployed for jobs in renewable energy. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why is a focus on a just transition for workers — from fossil fuel industries to renewable energy industries — an important thing to talk about in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic? There is an overlap between communities that are struggling with coronavirus that don’t have the resources to adequately fight it, and these rural regions that are fossil fuel communities. As we think about the stimulus, this is definitely an area of workers that should be covered. Because we can’t end fossil fuel extraction tomorrow. It will take us 10 years or so to be able to really plan for economic diversification and implement it so that these communities don’t go from having a tax base that is tied to coal mining to nothing. So, if we’re going to infuse, support and invest in projects that will put people to work, working towards transitioning fossil fuel communities away from extraction is something that we have to do now anyway. From a health perspective, is there something about renewable energy jobs that make workers safer in times like this, meaning disease outbreaks, than jobs in the fossil fuel industry?  The health impacts from these extractive industries would make people more susceptible to something like the coronavirus, because they’re already not in good health. The second thing is, I’ve seen reports of, coal miners for instance, and oil and gas drillers, whose jobs are considered to be essential. They’re not able to stay at home. So, they’re still constantly being exposed to the virus. They are bearing the brunt of our extractive economy, and then in times like now when there’s a pandemic, they are still right at the forefront. Part of the Green Stimulus asks for ramped-up resources and financing for electric vehicle manufacturing. Are there any caveats for that? For example, should Elon Musk expect a huge payout? Absolutely not. And we’ve put in points about prioritizing companies and projects that already have project labor agreements — at the minimum, they have to pay prevailing wage. This is something that’s really important as we think about job creation. Creating a bunch of bad jobs will just perpetuate both inequality and the climate crisis. Now is a time when we think about not just what we invest in but who we invest in. Businesses and manufacturers that pay and treat their workers with dignity are the ones that we want to be lifting up and investing in. There are also several provisions that focus on investing in women in the recovery. Why is that important? You can see that in terms of the occupations that are being hit, like health care and education, a lot of these are workforces that are majority women. We can say that women will bear the brunt of the negative economic consequences of the coronavirus. This emphasis on women is a way to acknowledge that historically women have been left out of things like manufacturing and tech. We’re focusing specifically on low-income communities, communities of color, indigenous communities, and other frontline communities that have been historically excluded from both the extractive economy and the current neoliberal economy that we have now. Many of the people working on the Green Stimulus proposal also worked on ARRA. What lessons are being taken into account?  First, ARRA was too small to address the magnitude of the crisis, which is why we’re calling for at least $2 trillion. I think ARRA showed how antiquated a lot of the programmatic infrastructure is. For instance, they tried to ramp up the weatherization program, but it could not handle that infusion of cash, just in terms of their basic infrastructure. That’s why a lot of our policies are really on the public sector, where we can stretch and advance a lot of these things, like renewable energy projects at utility scale, mass retrofitting of public housing. These are all things that we can do. Another issue with ARRA is that it focused on training workers for green new jobs, but didn’t focus as much on the demand side. So for us, what are the policies that we’re implementing that will not only create jobs, but also create demand for jobs? Like when we think about public procurement, that’s a lever that we can use to really ramp up manufacturing on the demand side, and that creates jobs. Critics are already arguing that ideas like the Green Stimulus or even the House Democrats’ recovery bill are just exploiting coronavirus to get Green New Deal policies passed. How do you respond to that? I understand where people are coming from, but I think what we need to realize is that what we’re having now is a total corporate stimulus. Are they also saying that Republicans are using this opportunity to really ramp up the corporate sector? I know people will ask: How do we make this politically feasible? But I think the focus should be more on what is the right thing to do. One thing that has come out from the coronavirus pandemic is how unjust our country really is. Like all the people that don’t have access to paid sick days, that don’t have access to health care, and understanding how deep our inequality really runs. This is something that has come to the surface, and this is an opportunity for us to address that.

“We won’t slash jobs, but we can’t pay you either.” That’s what the founders at a 200-person startup that created one of China’s most popular running apps told some of their employees in March. The statement sums up the predicament now faced by businesses across much of China, where the government is asking companies not to fire workers and offering incentives to keep them on the books. In February revenue at the Guangzhou-based company dropped to less than 10% of its usual monthly level as government-mandated measures to contain the  spread of the novel coronavirus confined runners to their homes. The founders, who asked that neither they nor the company be identified because of the sensitivity of talking about job losses, say they can no longer afford to pay all their workers yet are loath to dismiss them. A sudden spike in unemployment that might fill the streets with disgruntled workers has been a recurrent fear for the Communist Party of China, which has outlasted its Russian counterpart by almost 30 years, in part by consistently hitting its economic growth targets. In the late 1990s, when Premier Zhu Rongji carried out a sweeping reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that resulted in an estimated 2 million job cuts, sacked workers staged protests around the country. Now authorities are concerned that layoffs could further stoke popular discontent, which began bubbling up on Chinese social media platforms since evidence surfaced that government officials had  suppressed early reports about the risks posed by the virus and manipulated infection statistics. A widely scrutinized measure of urban unemployment jumped to 6.2% in February, the highest since the gauge was introduced in 2018. With a record 9 million university graduates entering the workforce in 2020, the rate could rise to as high as 10% this year, says Iris Pang, chief Greater China economist at ING Bank NV in Hong Kong.  Data: National Bureau of Statistics of China  Alarm bells are ringing in Beijing. “All relevant government departments should give top priority to stabilizing employment,” said Premier Li Keqiang at a March 10 meeting of the State Council, China’s top executive body. “As long as employment is stable this year, it is no big deal for the economy to grow a little bit faster or a little bit slower.” During previous economic shocks including the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and the 2008 global financial crisis, China was able to contain the rise in joblessness by ramping up investment in public works, directing banks to increase lending, and ordering state-owned enterprises to refrain from layoffs. The country also managed to weather the trade war with the U.S. last year without a marked increase in unemployment. This time the outlook may be much worse.  Lockdowns of cities, travel bans, and other measures enacted to contain the outbreak shut down a large swath of the economy for two months. Priority No. 1 now is getting businesses back on their feet. The government has  cut interest rates, allowed a more lenient stance on  bad loans, and  sped up the approval process for companies to restart operations. Even so, many of the nation’s private businesses say they’ve been unable to access the funding they need to meet upcoming payroll and debt payment deadlines. In a February survey of mostly small and medium-size enterprises by China Merchants Bank Co., two-thirds of the more than 20,000 respondents said they would be unable to stay in business for more than three months given their current cash reserves. Exporters, meanwhile, are seeing a plunge in orders from clients in North America, Europe, and the rest of Asia, as foreign governments step up their own public-health efforts. Under such circumstances, most companies would quickly move to dismiss workers. Yet in places such as Heilongjiang province in the northeast, SOEs have been instructed to limit layoffs. A number of Chinese provinces are offering refunds on social security payments as an inducement not to downsize, and additional incentives may be rolled out in the months ahead. Despite decades-long efforts to overhaul unprofitable SOEs, China’s leadership continues to rely on them as shock absorbers during times of economic strain. Workers there might have to tolerate shorter shifts, reduced pay, or unpaid leave, but they’ll keep their jobs. Yet the ranks of SOEs have thinned considerably over the years, meaning that a larger share of the country’s workers are employed in the private sector. Private companies contribute 80% of jobs in cities, according to Vice Premier Liu He. These businesses may be less willing—or less able—to comply with the government’s request to idle workers instead of firing them, even with added incentives such as delayed payment of social security contributions. Many Chinese university students have taken to Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform, to vent their frustrations over their career prospects. (“Graduation equals unemployment” is one slogan making the rounds.) The government has responded by expanding the number of openings at graduate school programs and directing public agencies and SOEs to give the new grads priority in hiring. That will still leave millions jockeying for jobs in the private sector, where about a third of companies plan to cut back on hiring, according to a February survey by Zhaopin.com, a site that caters to white-collar job seekers. Only 20% of the 9,000 companies polled said their hiring plans were unchanged, while almost 37% were unsure. The owners of the Guangzhou software startup don’t expect business to improve until September, when the competitive running season returns.

The amount of cash circulating in the euro area increased last week by the most since October 2008, in the latest sign that the coronavirus pandemic has sparked the biggest economic crunch at least since the global financial crisis. Cash jumped by by almost 19 billion euros ($20 billion), according to European Central Bank data. The ECB’s total balance sheet expanded by 223 billion euros as massive liquidity injections added to assets.

Yash Bazian went off his depression medication last year, because he felt his mental health was improving. But then came coronavirus. Sick people started climbing into the backseat of his car, and the nightmares started. Now he’s having trouble sleeping, and starting to gain weight. “Driving is already a very stressful job,” he said. “Imagine you add the stress of getting the virus when someone sneezes or coughs.” Bazian has been driving for Uber and Lyft in the Bay Area for three years. The work has been slower ever since the region’s shelter-in-place rules — meaning all nonessential services were to be avoided — took effect on March 17. But it hasn’t stopped. Under the now-statewide shelter orders, the private transportation industry is deemed essential. And with fears of crowding aboard buses and subways, ride-hail has become an ever-more vital supplement to the public transit that’s been chugging along down empty streets. The ride-hail drivers still on the road have been left to contend not only with weekly incomes slashed in half, but with mounting fears that by welcoming strangers into their cars, they’re inviting the virus in, too. These risks are shared by others who have joined doctors and nurses to become the de facto first responders to the coronavirus pandemic: grocery store and postal workers, delivery drivers, janitors and domestic workers, e-commerce shippers. Many of these workers are treated like independent contractors — they lack employer-provided health insurance, sick leave, or unemployment benefits. The risks of staying on the job are higher; so are the risks of stopping. “The sickness is the least of my priorities. The drop in revenue is the highest priority,” said Edan Alva, a Lyft driver who’s based in Alameda. “I live pretty much from road to mouth.” There’s a clear tension between ride-hailing and the CDC’s social distancing recommendations of keeping six feet away from others. To limit contact between passengers and drivers, Uber and Lyft have stopped all pooled rides in the U.S. and Canada markets where they’re offered. Before each new passenger gets into his car, Alva attacks each surface with disinfectant. He treats the backseat with rubbing alcohol and wipes, cleaning the lock, the door handle, the inside of the passenger door and the seatbelt buckles. He sprays the whole thing down with Lysol — especially after driving a passenger that is “coughing or displaying any signs of sickness” — and then Febreze, to cover the citrus scent. The whole routine takes 15 minutes. While Uber and Lyft have both said they’re working on providing cleaning supplies to drivers for free, Alva said he had to cover the $25 to $30 in costs himself. Bazian, too, is upping his cleaning regimen, and wearing gloves and a mask on the road. He’s spending an additional $10 and $15 a day on anti-virus supplies, he says. Most of his morning rides have been for older people getting groceries. They’re wary of him and the germs of his previous passengers, and he’s just as wary of them. “I hear some people sometimes sneeze in my car and say, ‘It’s just allergies,’” Bazian said. “I don’t know if it’s just allergies or not.” He also drives for Uber Assist, a service meant to help elderly individuals get to care appointments with a more experienced driver. “In the last couple of weeks since March started, I drove four to six people to the hospital and from the hospital,” he said. Alva has driven several passengers who appear to have an illness, he says, though he’s never sure what kind. He hasn’t taken any trips to or from a hospital, but he did drop an elderly woman off at the doctor’s to get a pneumonia shot. Mostafa Maklad, a driver for Uber and Lyft who lives in Daly City, says he’s picked up doctors and nurses on the way to work shifts. As regular movement around the city stalls, the highest-risk trips — such as shuttling health care workers or patients to and from hospitals — may become more prevalent, as Lyft and Uber try to bolster drivers’ earnings by diverting them to do other public health tasks. Lyft offers drivers the chance to join the LyftUp Driver Task Force, to do paid rides that “help neighbors get to grocery stores, workers to hospitals, and caretakers to their jobs,” and is working with government agencies to do test kit drop-offs. The company will also continue to partner with Medicaid agencies to serve as non-emergency medical transportation to doctor’s appointments. Uber Health, which gets patients to doctor’s appointments, is continuing to operate, too. “It’s important to call out that Uber Health is serving the non-emergency medical transportation space and that ridesharing is not equipped or aiming to serve as an alternative to specialized or emergency medical transportation,” said Xavier Van Chau, head of business product communications for Uber. “Examples of when Uber Health is used include travel to a dialysis appointment or a physiotherapy visit.” These trips are booked through a dashboard by health-care providers, who are tasked with assessing what kind of transportation is most appropriate. “[T]hat would exclude transporting patients who may be contagious,” Van Chau said. Despite such safeguards, there’s widespread fear that sick patients will turn to the platform anyway. Already, people afraid of incurring the high cost of an ambulance call ride-hail to pick them up in case of emergency. When the mother of a young boy from Westport, Connecticut, learned he had tested positive for Covid-19, the school called him an Uber home. To protect riders, Uber and Lyft have both said that they’ll suspend drivers who have contracted Covid-19. Uber started a 14-day sick fund to pay drivers if they test positive for the disease or if their doctor suggests they self-quarantine “due to their risk of spreading Covid-19;” Lyft’s policy, too, covers drivers with the disease and those who have been “put under individual quarantine” by a public health agency. Alva says neither policy helps him much — because of his high deductible, it would cost too much to get that doctor’s note. Moira Muntz, the spokesperson for New York City’s Independent Drivers Guild, had lobbied Uber and Lyft to strengthen their sick fund coverage. “We are glad that Uber and Lyft agreed to provide sick pay to any driver with a doctor’s note to self-isolate, but they urgently need to raise awareness of this policy and make the process easier or we will have sick and at-risk drivers continuing to work,” she said. She worries that only drivers who are at risk of spreading the disease — not at high risk of contracting a serious case of it — will be eligible. Drivers are at the front lines of the coronavirus crisis in other ways, too. On the road, they also share in people’s most intimate moments — they know where passengers travel to and from, and bear witness to the preoccupations that dominate their small talk and private phone calls. As the pandemic grips U.S. cities, they are shuttling the sick and the healthy, the fearful and foolhardy. They’re hearing first-hand how people are dealing with the uncertainty, even as they, too, grow more worried. “Anybody who’s not feeling this is either sorely misguided or inattentive,” said Steve Gregg, who’s been driving for Uber and Lyft in the Bay Area for three years and completed 16,000 rides. He’s also a member of Gig Workers Rising, an organization that advocates for independent contractors. Gregg, 51, is in more than one high-risk category for coronavirus: Along with high blood pressure, he says, he’s diabetic and borderline obese. His lungs have “been through a lot.” (“Even if I were to get it and survive it, the scar tissue in my lungs would probably be so bad that they’d be irrevocably damaged,” he said.) When he thought the virus only spread through touching infected surfaces, he felt he’d be OK and kept driving. But when he learned that it was also airborne, he got off the street immediately. “It’s like Russian roulette,” he said. “It’s a game I don’t play.” He started self-quarantining last week, which means he can’t see his children, either. Even after this ends, he’ll struggle to visit them, he says: They live 50 miles away, and he can’t afford his rental-car payment anymore. “What is it worth to put my life on the line to make not even minimum wage? I can’t do that,” he said. “It comes back to my children again. A few hundred bucks a month compared to not having a father.” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is lobbying the federal government to include drivers and delivery workers in any federal stimulus plan. New York City is rehiring some out-of-work Uber and Lyft drivers to do food delivery for at-risk seniors, on a first-come, first-serve basis, for $15 an hour (lower than the city’s ride-hail minimum wage, but with a commitment to pay their expenses.) Gregg is particularly frustrated that Uber and Lyft can be deemed an essential service in California and yet not be covered by basic labor rights. “How can this government — that has consistently sold out gig workers over and over — then turn around and expect us to be emergency service personnel, with no safety net, in the face of the worst pandemic in 100 years?” he said. Last year, California passed Assembly Bill 5, which was intended to enshrine misclassified gig workers like ride-hail and delivery drivers with full employment rights. So far, however, driver advocates argue that the rule hasn’t been adequately enforced; Uber, Lyft and other gig delivery companies have refused to comply with its guidance, arguing that their drivers are not misclassified, and fighting AB5 in court. In a press conference on March 24, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors introduced* a resolution to push the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to step in to enforce AB5, and asked the city and state attorneys to file an injunction allowing workers to access employment benefits. They also called on the city’s Department of Public Health to issue minimum health and safety requirements, which include providing additional sanitary supplies and workers’ compensation benefits “should they come into contact with a customer who has been infected.” “There’s always a segment of the population who is or will be in desperate need of work and can be taken advantage of, theoretically,” said Alva. “The question is: Do we as a society want the people who are desperate to be taken advantage of to the point where they can’t afford their own health care?” CORRECTION: San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors introduced a resolution to push officials to enforce AB5. It has not yet passed.

Chevron Corp. became the latest major oil company to take an ax to its budget after halting its $5 billion-a-year share buyback and halving spending in the Permian Basin, which means a large decrease in projected output from America’s biggest shale region. The California-based oil giant said Tuesday it’s lowering projected 2020 capital spending by 20%, or $4 billion. The Permian will account for the largest single element of that reduction, translating into 125,000 fewer barrels of oil equivalent per day than previously forecast, a quantity equal to about 2.5% of the basin’s total current production.

Disease shapes cities. Some of the most iconic developments in urban planning and management, such as London’s Metropolitan Board of Works and mid-19th century sanitation systems, developed in response to public health crises such as cholera outbreaks. Now COVID-19 is joining a long list of infectious diseases, like the Spanish flu of 1918 in New York and Mexico City or the Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa in 2014, likely to leave enduring marks on urban spaces. For Michele Acuto, professor of global urban politics in the School of Design at the University of Melbourne, the intersection of urban design and public health is an increasingly critical territory. He’s the director of the Connected Cities Lab, a leading center for advancing urban policy development; he’s worked on urban health in a number of capacities, including with the European Commission and the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific Regional Office. While the University of Melbourne scrambles to accelerate a COVID-19 vaccine, the Lab is working to understand the urban planning dimensions of pandemic preparedness.   CityLab spoke to Acuto about why COVID-19 could change how we study cities — and how we live in them. Much of the coverage of the new coronavirus feels unprecedented, as if this is the first time urban spaces and global movement of goods and people have given rise to the threat of pandemic. But the stories of cities have always also been those of infectious disease. Anyone you talk to on the urban or medical side would tell you this is not new. You can do parallels between COVID-19 and many other epi- and pandemics, from the plague to SARS and Ebola. The line of caution we need here is not to draw too many parallels or rushed conclusions without evidence. COVID-19 is not as deadly as Ebola, which had a mortality rate of 60%, or SARS and MERS at 30%. But if the risk of death is lower, transmission is much higher, and that makes it challenging globally. Quarantines only work insofar as you can identify all dangerous cases, and with COVID-19’s symptoms and delayed onset, you can’t spot it that easily. In that way this is much more similar to the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, which inflected 500 million and killed up to 50 million.* The question is whether we are prepared to avoid that. Looking back, did we miss something in the way we were thinking about the intersection of urbanization and infectious disease? Were we looking in the wrong places? Yes, to a degree. We have perhaps been a bit too biased toward global cities. COVID-19 is really a story of peri-urban and rural-to-urban connections, in places that are often not on the global map. Roger Keil, Creighton Connolly and Harris Ali recently argued for this suburban view. They tell the story of how the spread to Germany starts with a car [parts] factory in the outskirts in Wuhan. A person travels from Wuhan to Germany to help with training. This is a story of peri-urban Wuhan to semi-suburban, tertiary-city Bavaria. So sure, you have some of the global connections at airports, but it’s a much more complex urban system. This is a rich point. It’s easy to look at these major cities and global supply chains, and say of course we have an epidemic — this is how globalization plays itself out. But you’re telling a different story — one about non-global cities, tertiary cities and peri-urban areas.  Yes, it’s actually about a much wider set of urban areas. This is the story in Washington state [where COVID-19 first emerged in Snohomish County], or the Italian story, which is still largely suburban. Part of the history of urbanization is building and managing your way out of infectious diseases, such as cholera outbreaks in the middle of the 19th century. Here’s Richard Sennett on how Joseph Bazalgette and his colleagues went about developing London’s response: “They were not practising an exact science. They did not apply established principles in particular cases, there were no general policies that dictated best practices.” They experimented and learned as they went along, he argues. How do you conceive of the design approach to managing outbreaks in everything from global to tertiary cities? It’s a bit early to take on lessons learned from COVID-19, but you’d probably have a big conversation about the value versus the risks of densification. Clearly densification is and has been the problem with some of this. COVID-19 puts a fundamental challenge to how we manage urbanization. Hong Kong has 17,311 people per square mile. Rethinking density management is a key for long-term survival in a pandemic world, really. Part of this means thinking about decentralization of essential services. Singapore had to shut down its main hospitals during SARS. Many countries such as Italy are considering door-to-door testing. But we need to also rethink the ways, perhaps digital ones, we test and contain. How would we manage to do door-to-door testing even just in Melbourne alone, with 5 million residents, and in giants like Shanghai and London with upwards of 10 million dwellers? Bubbling up are some core questions about what we’ve been told is desirable urbanization versus what makes sense from an infectious disease perspective. Here’s a difficult question. Even Le Corbusier, who prized efficiency and movement, understood the value of people bumping into each other. It gives cities their energy and cosmopolitanism its effect. I wonder if you think this decentralized city — a London of villages, Mayor Hidalgo’s 15-minute Paris — will be part of our response in urban form? Here’s a way to think about it. SARS got some people to think about cities and their connectivity as a fundamental factor. Fast-forward to Ebola and that got people to think about the coexistence of cities in the Global North and South, and the ferocity of the city itself — the impossibility of just cordoning it off. The city is not a thing: it’s an amorphous blob. Fast forward to now, and we’ve moved beyond Global North-Global South thinking. It’s one very large system, given it’s really about that connection between, for example, [the Italian village of] Codogno and the outskirts of Wuhan. Hopefully this gets us to think about some fundamental principles. We need to begin with a new imagination of the urban data we rely on. The best thing a professional probably looks at in this moment is Johns Hopkins’s CSSE aggregator of information. It splashes together data sources from WHO, NHS, and so on. Many national governments’ “official” numbers lag, so there’s better information by aggregating different sources of information. But this also brings into play the current digital revolution and the challenges of evidence that has different levels of legitimacy. Had this happened not, say, in China but in some place like India with very strong informal settlements, you’d potentially be arguing that something like Slum Dwellers International, which uses local mapping and communities to source data, would probably be the best-suited entity to support the collection of information. You’ve gotten something there about the legitimacy of different types of urban knowledge and the need to rethink who are the right sources of it. Moving from that information to changes within the built environment again, we know the management of water and waste helped remake cities. Can you predict the area where we might see a radical transformation coming out of this? We must remember you will be weighing such changes in the context of climate change and sustainability as well. If you spread the city rather than densify, that would have to go with much better connectivity of public transport. What should change — the decentralization of services, better managing of supplies, nets of smaller entities in food delivery, for instance — is different from will. Will market forces sway the things we do towards what’s marketable and economically profitable versus saying this clearly is a call for redundancy in public health and public transport? One thing I’ve barely heard talked about is the digital response here, which didn’t exist at all at the time of most of our historic parallels. It existed a bit during Ebola, but not in the same size as this. Major services like Tencent and AliBaba can tell you who is sick in your neighborhood, and people are making daily decisions based on the whole digital infrastructure. I come from an hour from the “red zone” in Italy, and family and friends make a lot of decisions based on digital connectivity information. Modern planning and civil engineering were born out of the mid-19th century development of sanitation in response to the spread of malaria and cholera in cities. Digital infrastructure might be the sanitation of our time.*CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story used an inaccurate figure for the 1918 influenza epidemic.

Early on the morning of March 3, hours after a tornado devastated parts of Nashville, Anne Barnett grabbed her chainsaw and got to work. A friend with a truck drove with her to North Nashville, a predominantly African American neighborhood that was struck especially hard by the storm. Felled trees blocked the roads. Telephone poles were snapped in two. Downed power lines snaked across streets. Other volunteers showed up with heavy work gloves and trucks, ready to help haul tree limbs away. It was hard to know where to start or where to go, Barnett says, because the damage stretched in every direction. Others were drawn to North Nashville that morning, too — but not to volunteer. “Within two hours, I saw a wealthier-looking, white, middle-aged gentleman walking around, talking to homeowners and handing out business cards,” Barnett says. “We were cutting a tree out of this elderly lady’s yard, and I was like, ‘What was he talking about?’ She was like, ‘He wanted me to sell my house.’ I was like, ‘Are you fucking kidding me?’” The storm claimed at least 24 lives across four counties in Middle Tennessee, destroying some 400 homes in Nashville. But even as the first city workers were arriving in affected neighborhoods, real-estate investors were already on the scene in North Nashville, looking to relieve distressed homeowners of their properties, according to Barnett as well as other community members who heard rumors about house offers. While the details of reported offers are unclear, Barnett’s observation raises an issue that has popped up before during crises in this and other historically black Nashville neighborhoods. A surge of speculation in the wake of the storm would suit the hot Nashville market — residents in this part of the city are used to getting mailers and phone calls with cash offers for their homes. Now, the pressure on residents is tremendous, thanks in part to a federal program that has singled out this neighborhood for investment. In 2018, North Nashville was designated as an Opportunity Zone, the Trump administration’s place-based tax incentive program designed to lure capital to distressed areas. Local housing advocates, fearing that homeowners who were affected by the storm might feel like they have few other options, are putting together workshops to offer legal and financial advice to residents in North Nashville, which still lacks electricity. There’s even a hashtag-ready motto for the resistance campaign: “Don’t Sell Out North,” referring to a name that longtime natives use for the neighborhood, Out North. “Developers have been chomping at the bit thinking about that neighborhood for a while,” says Barnett, who is an organizer with the Central Labor Council for Nashville and Middle Tennessee. “It’s really, really scary to think about how this storm is going to change that neighborhood, not just the way it looks but who lives there and who has equity there.” There are good reasons to worry. Framed by the Cumberland River and cut off from the rest of the city by two urban-renewal-era highways, North Nashville is one of the poorest places in the metro area. The median income for much of North Nashville is about $29,000, with some 36% of households living in poverty. In an adjacent census tract — Germantown, just across I-65 — the median income is $97,000. Many black homeowners in North Nashville lack the cash in hand that it takes to weather a crisis. (Most of the area’s residents are renters, who face a different precarious situation.) Working through insurance claims and federal assistance takes time; the process can be exhausting and intimidating. If investors showed up with their checkbooks the morning after the storm, they may have been offering stressed-out residents a life raft. Zulfat Suara, an at-large member of Nashville Metro Council,  says that she hasn't seen direct evidence that speculators are now looking to buy houses from storm victims in North Nashville. “Historically, that’s happened before,” she says, referring to speculation following part storms. “That’s my understanding from people who have lived in the community for a long time. People are saying that’s already happening.” Most homeowners are better off staying in their homes, if they’re able to, says Charlane Oliver, cofounder and executive director for the Equity Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group. Her group is holding two community meetings on March 9 in North Nashville to bring together attorneys, insurance agents, financial counselors, and local officials to talk with folks about their options. “We don’t want these homeowners to sell their property,” Oliver says. “It can be more valuable as a homeowner and landowner to keep that property.” To Odessa Kelly of Stand Up Nashville, a local coalition of community groups and labor unions, the threat of neighborhood displacement in the wake of the tornado looks like a local illustration of “disaster capitalism,” the term that author and activist Naomi Klein coined for profit-seeking amid natural or man-made catastrophes. Traumatized residents of distressed neighborhoods are especially vulnerable to exploitation, and the need for legal expertise is every bit as urgent as mobilization drives for food and flashlights. “Organizers are first responders,” Kelly says. Much of the destruction associated with the March 3 storm happened in Germantown and East Nashville, which are home to Nashville’s world-famous nightlife districts. Residents of North Nashville work in those bars and restaurants, Oliver says, compounding the problems they face at home. Some residents working in the service industry may have lost both their homes and workplaces. By almost any indicator, North Nashville is a highly distressed community. A report by the Brookings Institution found that the zip code that encompasses North Nashville has the highest incarceration rate in the country, for example. But the area may be uniquely vulnerable to exploitation in the wake of a disaster. The think tank that helped to write the Opportunity Zone legislation, the Economic Innovation Group, has compiled detailed statistical reports with scores measuring a community’s well-being. Among those scores is the cold-and-calculating-sounding Social Vulnerability Index, which measures a community’s ability to endure crises. “Communities that are more vulnerable to disasters, whether natural or human-made, have higher risk factors, including higher presence of vulnerable people and higher levels of housing instability,” the EIG report reads. On a scale of zero to one, a North Nashville tract almost pegs this misery meter, earning a 0.98. “These are the type of social ills that we are dealing with,” Oliver says. “People have not seen the improvements in their communities for decades. We’re feeling the remnants of the war on drugs, mass incarceration, blighted areas, gentrification. All of that is affecting this area.” Opportunity Zones were meant to shift these long-established patterns of disinvestment. Part of the massive tax cut package passed by Congress in December 2017, the Opportunity Zone program allows investors to defer their tax liability on capital gains by investing in assets within designated communities. But states were given great leeway in designating census tracts within their borders, and the IRS set few boundaries on what counted as qualified investments. What has resulted, say critics, is a “once-in-a-generation bonanza for elite investors.” Cadre, a start-up that specializes in real-estate investments in Opportunity Zones, has targeted Nashville among other cities. In an investment profile in January, Cadre compared the city to pre-boom Austin, describing Nashville as a “coveted real estate opportunity.” Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, just sold his stake in Cadre for between $25 million and $50 million. Speculators descending on North Nashville right now may simply be looking to flip properties. The New York Times reported on an unverified rumor that people in Land Rovers were scouting houses in the neighborhood this week. Oliver says that North Nashville is a target for developers looking to build “tall-and-skinnies” — narrow two-story houses, usually built in pairs, that have popped up in place of demolished one-story houses across the city. Oliver says that these detached duplexes tend to be used for short-term rental platforms such as Airbnb, not rental housing. Gentrification in Nashville has proceeded hand-in-hand with a surge in experience-based tourism. Music City is now the nation’s capital for bachelorette parties. That’s a danger for a gentrifying North Nashville in the grip of a deep affordability crisis — especially now that a natural disaster is forcing longtime residents to choose between surviving and preserving their homes and communities. Residents who choose to stay are now eligible for individual assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This weekend, teams of canvassers with clipboards organized by the local Equity Alliance will go door-to-door to try to assess the needs of local homeowners (and renters) in hopes of assembling a database to hand over to FEMA once the agency puts boots on the ground. Right now, the people living in North Nashville are struggling to meet their basic needs. They might not know that help is on the way; in these vulnerable moments, a cash offer from a well-dressed man in a suit might look tempting. “What we don’t want to see happen is what happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,” Oliver says. “You had developers come into the Ninth Ward and buy up all the properties. Now the Ninth Ward doesn’t look like the Ninth Ward anymore.”

Europeans grumble that they haven’t had a truly global tech giant since Nokia Oyj’s heyday. But for Europe’s banks, the most pressing digital need isn’t for a homegrown phone that can compete with Apple Inc.’s or Google’s. The banks are looking for cloud computing providers with higher security standards than they can find in the U.S. Their search is far from over. In a recent Bloomberg survey of Europe’s top banks, 22 of 22 respondents said their primary cloud services are American. The three leading U.S. cloud providers—Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—are at the top, though unlike in the broader market, Microsoft Corp. beats out Amazon.com Inc. for No. 1. Rounding out the list are IBM, Salesforce.com, and NetApp. While some lenders say they also work with European cloud companies, it’s usually in a secondary role. The U.S. companies’ servers support the sophisticated numbers crunching for tasks like risk management and increasingly house such sensitive data as borrowers’ personal information. The banks aren’t happy about this. The virtue of off-site cloud servers is that their scale generally allows companies to store and compute data for less than they’d spend on their own—and the prices per unit of storage tend to decrease markedly with each passing year. Europe’s institutions are already losing the investment banking wars with Wall Street and can’t afford to cede competitive advantages. But some bankers say they worry about client data in the hands of foreign companies. U.S. tech doesn’t enjoy the reputation for trustworthiness that it did even a few years ago, when European regulators were among the first to challenge the industry’s standards for privacy and competition.  Data: Compiled by Bloomberg  Now, German and French government officials are in talks with leaders in telecommunications, technology, and finance to create a competitive continental cloud service run by local tech companies. At the same time, banks including Germany’s Commerzbank AG are trying to team up to present joint cloud demands to U.S. providers in an effort to increase the little leverage they have. “Europe is looking at ensuring technological sovereignty and reducing its dependence because it does fear that somehow, all of a sudden, technologies that we depend on could be switched off,” says Eline Chivot, a Brussels-based analyst at the Center for Data Innovation, a U.S. think tank. The banks’ odds aren’t great. Previous attempts to build European alternatives to U.S. tech have foundered, and at this point the upfront costs would be immense. Microsoft says it spends more than $1 billion a year just on its global cloud network’s security, while European banks are struggling with declining revenue and profit. “In 2020, waking up and saying that we want to build a European cloud, I’d say it may be too late,” says Bernard Gavgani, chief information officer at French banking group BNP Paribas SA.  Data: European Banking Authority  Big Tech is also savvier about lobbying regulators than it used to be, working actively to charm market watchdogs it ignored five years ago, say three regulators who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter. Patrice Amann, a leader of the Microsoft cloud team catering to financial-services companies in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, says increased outreach efforts represent an interest in a constructive dialogue. “It’s really to understand what is the concern, how this concern is progressing, and what we need to do as a company to comply completely with the rules,” Amann says. There’s no legal requirement for banks to keep data in the European Union, but the bloc’s regulators have nudged them in that direction. Several cloud companies offer lenders the use of servers based in Europe or their home country specifically. “They need to evaluate the risk of having data in a location that applies different security and data protection standards,” says Slavka Eley, head of banking markets, innovation, and products at the European Banking Authority. “If the risk is too high, they shouldn’t agree to such locations.”  Data: Bloomberg survey asking “Who is your primary cloud provider?” Note: Some banks said they have multiple primary providers DNB ASA picked Amazon and Microsoft largely because the Norwegian country’s watchdog approved of the company’s audit policies for cloud network security and because “they have a number of data centers in Europe and the Nordics,” says Alf Otterstad, the bank’s head of technology and services. Still, under President Trump’s Cloud Act, U.S. storage providers can be ordered to provide U.S. authorities information held on their servers no matter where that data are physically located. The U.S. companies say they’ll defend client privacy. Andreas Wodtke, a vice president for financial services at IBM Corp. who sells cloud services to banks in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, says the U.S. company will resist demands for data from state agencies unless they’re made through internationally recognized channels such as mutual legal assistance treaties. By the end of 2020, the European coalition working to develop a viable local cloud network hopes to complete its first proof-of-concept testing. For now, though, the Continent’s banks remain unambiguously dependent on Seattle and Silicon Valley. “You hurt Germans with car tariffs or the French by taxing red wine,” says Heiko Gewald, a professor of information management at the Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences in southern Germany. “But if you want to hit Europe as a whole, then cloud is the way to go.” — With assistance by Boris Groendahl, and Sonia Sirletti

A growing number of states are requiring health insurers to waive copays and other out-of-pocket expenses for coronavirus testing to make sure family budgetary challenges don’t slow efforts to control the outbreak. “States are looking for ways to encourage people to get the care they need,” Kevin Lucia, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said Friday. He expects more states to follow the lead of those that have already imposed coronavirus-related requirements on insurers.

The evening I found out Ahmaud Arbery was killed, I fried whiting fish in the air fryer, and I can’t lie, it was damn good. So good that I had to have two Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls to complement the meal along with the broccoli and cauliflower. Afterwards, I felt I might have overdone it a bit so I decided I’d take a walk. By this time, it’s 9 p.m. I walked to my front door, and told my fiancée that I’d be back soon. She said OK, with a tinge of trepidation — just enough to snap me back into reality. I was reminded that I live in America, in a nice neighborhood, and that I am a large negro. My mind flooded with scenarios of everything that could go wrong on my walk, based on everything that had gone wrong for others like me. Others whose nights I imagine began as innocently as my own. Just when I thought that I had become desensitized to racial violence, the death of Arbery had struck me to my core. Arbery, 25, was shot twice while out for a jog by Travis McMichael, who with father Gregory, chased Arbery in a pickup truck. Gregory told the police that he thought he looked like a man suspected in neighborhood break-ins. There was no way for me to rationalize in the slightest why he was murdered. Arbery’s killing, which happened while he was doing something so seemingly routine — jogging — had me unwittingly fearful of exercising one of the most basic of human rights, the right to simply exist. While I absolutely have routines that I run through as a black man —  i.e. my “police protocol,” my “workforce protocol,” etc.  — prior to what happened with Arbery, I did not run through a checklist for something as benign as taking a walk in my neighborhood. Still, on this particular evening, I grabbed my photo ID and my credit card, just in case. But my ID still had my permanent address in Richmond, Virginia, and I’m in Fredericksburg. That wouldn’t help me. I grabbed the water bill to prove that I live in this neighborhood. I headed back towards the door, only to catch a glimpse of myself in the hall mirror. I probably didn’t look like I lived in this neighborhood. Back upstairs I went. Almost by muscle memory, I threw on a University of Virginia hoodie and a U.Va. hat. Even racists love U.Va., or its home of Charlottesville at least. I contemplated throwing on my U.Va. Law hoodie but feared it may have been too much. Would someone feel intimidated and use that as provocation? My anger began rising. “It’s just a walk!” I told myself as I left the closet clad in orange and blue. But it wasn’t. For the first time, I had to admit to myself that I may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms related to the unfettered onslaught of violence against African Americans in America. I released a deep breath and walked toward the front door, which felt like a precipice. I walked through, now properly garbed, music blaring into my headphones. I paused on the front step. What if someone is yelling for me to stop and I don’t hear them? I left one earbud dangling. It’s safer anyway.  It’s now 9:15 p.m. Confronting the cool air outside, I reached up to pull on my hoodie, then thought better of it. As I walked, I mentally rehearsed the script of what I would say if I was stopped by a police officer or an overzealous neighborhood watchman questioning my whereabouts. When I arrived back home, I found solace in the fact that of the 200 calories that I had spent on those two rolls, I’d burned 194, and I smiled. But it only papered over the sadness I felt thinking about the world my children will inherit. While I have exposed them to the reality of how the world will treat them as African American children, it is always under the guise that we are trending toward a better and brighter tomorrow. But as the deaths mount, it has become increasingly hard to shield them from the trauma that accompanies. I fear that they too will one day struggle with the PTSD that I am just now admitting I suffer.   As the son of an Army man who served in the 82nd Airborne during Vietnam, I don’t use the term PTSD term lightly. I’ve heard the stories and seen the look in my father’s eyes and I know what trauma looks like, which is why I can recognize its effects on my actions. Those with PTSD, according to the American Psychiatric Association, continue to have “intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings” related to their experience of witnessing a trauma well after the event has ended. They can also feel sadness, fear, or anger; they may feel “detached or estranged from other people,” and may be easily startled or have strong negative reactions to loud noise or an accidental touch. Many African Americans live in a constant state of trauma, brought on by the high levels of generational violence in their communities, the seemingly endless stream of controversial encounters between law enforcement and unarmed African Americans citizens, the subtle and overt racism experienced daily, and now the rise in what can only be considered vigilantism veiled in loosely interpreted laws.   Through this trauma, African Americans have developed a list of unspoken rules on how to simply exist, learned by verdicts meted out by a legal system that continually fails at what most would consider justice and evidenced by a myriad of hashtags forged in fear. We’ve learned that: We can’t relax in the comfort of our own homes (#BothemJean and #AtatianaJefferson). We can't ask for help after being in a car crash (#JonathanFerrell and #RenishaMcBride). We can’t sell CD's (#AltonSterling). We can’t sleep (#AiyanaJones). We can’t go to church (#Charleston9). We can’t get a normal traffic ticket (#SandraBland). We can’t lawfully carry a weapon (#PhilandoCastile). We can’t shop at Walmart (#JohnCrawford). We can’t ask a cop a question (#RandyEvans). We can’t cash our check in peace (#YvonneSmallwood). We can’t run (#WalterScott). We can’t breathe (#EricGarner). We can’t live (#FreddieGray). We can’t exist. No wrongful death can be condoned, but for many, a vigilante killing like Arbery’s without the cloak of authority provided to law enforcement has inched us perilously close to a tipping point. Many are still reeling from the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Police initially declined to arrest his killer George Zimmerman under Florida’s “stand your ground” law. Now, eight years later, Arbery was shot and killed by a white man in Brunswick, Georgia, on Feb. 23 — three days before the anniversary of the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin. The shooter and his father were arrested only after several months of protests and the release of a video depicting the shooting. And now, we can’t go jogging (#AhmaudArbery). While many have taken to the Childish Gambino view of America, myself included, one never knows what will trigger someone exposed to consistent trauma. I am far more affected than I could have imagined. What if that were me? Have I lived a life such that even without video evidence, my character will have shone through if I am gunned down? If a 43-year-old black man educated at an elite law school carries such a mental load when he exercises the most basic of his freedoms, then what kind of trauma must those who are less socially and financially secure experience? We suffer from trauma and Ahmaud Arbery has reminded us that still, we wear the mask.

There’s burnout, and then there’s  pandemic-induced burnout. For many workers, the professional environment has changed radically since Covid-19 disrupted life—but the intensity of their jobs hasn’t. Juggling full-time responsibilities, family life, and the stress of confinement makes the risk of burnout greater than ever. Digital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush, whose book Hustle & Float: Reclaim Your Creativity and Thrive in a World Obsessed With Work investigated the epidemic of burnout, says solutions must go beyond treating symptoms such as exhaustion and anxiety. Instead of merely prescribing rest, exercise, and healthful eating, she says it’s time to deconstruct the underlying cultural sources of burnout and do something radical: Work less. Here, she explains how. Since the Industrial Revolution, the dominant philosophy of work has centered around productivity as the only metric that’s important for success. As work culture developed, we’ve internalized the idea that any time that isn’t spent doing something is wasted time. Worse, we’ve been made to believe that if we aren’t struggling and hustling, we don’t deserve our success. And now, our relationship to work has become tied to our sense of self and self-worth. But this ideology runs counter to scientific research that says that in order for knowledge workers to do their best work, they need space and unstructured time. The structure upon which we’ve built our work expectations has been hurting us for a long time. When you combine our culture of chronic overwork with the distraction inherent to technology and social media, at a time when people are forced to stay at home, you have a recipe for amplified anxiety and shame. This puts people on a fast-track to burnout. We have to build a system of work that reflects how our brains actually function and what our creativity needs. That begins with incorporating recovery into the process of work. You can’t be innovative if you’re not creative, and you can’t be creative if you’re stressed, exhausted, distracted, or sleep-deprived. Resting doesn’t mean diverting from your goals but rather making it possible to achieve them. I’m not saying don’t hustle. I’m saying, whether it’s a pandemic or not, it’s crucial to recover hard when you play hard. This isn’t a normal time, so it shouldn’t be treated as normal work-from-home time. The lines between home and work, personal and professional, are blurred with an additional pressure to be productive since the thinking is that we all suddenly have more available time. This isn’t the case, and furthermore, working nonstop simply doesn’t work. We have turned busyness into a coping mechanism. Now, people are applying that to their personal time while sheltering at home, filling it with back-to-back Zoom calls, baking, workouts, and more activity. It’s important to use some of this time to process our emotions and reflect on the discomfort from all this productivity propaganda. Operating as usual will not only negatively affect your work but could compromise your health. There are steps we can all take. For example, take 30 minutes to eat lunch without stimulation: no email, no Slack, no distraction. You can even start with 15 minutes! It’s up to us to carve out periods of time to give our cognitive capabilities the chance to unwind. Then consider managing up: Workers can be explicit in asking for expectations from their managers. Move from unspoken rules to written guidelines so everyone understands how to navigate this period of working from home. Start by paying attention to discomfort. If you’re feeling restless, anxious, or guilty, sit with it and start to dig deep to understand what’s behind it. We have to give ourselves the time to shift from a more-is-better approach to internalizing the idea that recovery is as valuable as the work. No one can do that for us. Put recovery time in your calendar and stick to it. If you don’t, force yourself to write down why you didn’t. The real exercise in moving past work devotion and burnout is in understanding why we’re not giving ourselves that time. It isn’t due to a lack of knowledge. I would also suggest timing your tasks to understand how much time you really need. This will allow you to make realistic to-do lists and avoid feeling overwhelmed. Remember: We are constrained by time, and yet we overestimate our self-expectations constantly. This is something that can be fixed. If you’re a high performer and recovery isn’t an intentional and strategic part of your time and workflow, you’re only damaging your output in the long run.

While “automation” can be a scary word to some workers, it may actually help mitigate pandemic-fueled job uncertainty and the depth of the recession, according to a working paper by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. As job uncertainty mounts, as seen in the current environment of stay-at-home orders and business closings, demand drops, unemployment increases and inflation falls, Sylvain Leduc and Zheng Liu write in “Can Pandemic-Induced Job Uncertainty Stimulate Automation?” Companies that in turn automate some of the jobs formerly held by humans fuel an increase in labor productivity. That increase partly offsets the recessionary impact of unemployment and falling inflation, Leduc and Liu found.

Are central bankers too strong or too weak? Unfortunately for the global economy, the answer is both: Their control of money is a blunt instrument that’s good for achieving some objectives, but worthless for others. Never has the disparity been clearer than now, with financial markets soaring on the back of easy monetary policy even as many lives are wrecked by the Covid-19 pandemic. How central bankers should grapple with the paradox of their power and powerlessness was the theme of a 36-minute videoconference on Nov. 16 that was part of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. The forum, which runs through Nov. 19, is organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. For central banks, the hammer is monetary policy, which involves—as the Federal Reserve puts it—“managing the level of short-term interest rates and influencing the availability and cost of credit in the economy.” The tool was essential earlier this year in preventing pandemic-related economic shutdowns from crashing the financial system.  But while central banks can lend, they can’t make outright grants. While they can make overall financial conditions easier, they can’t direct funds to sectors, or segments of the public, that are in special trouble. To their credit, central bankers have recognized their limitations and called on the fiscal authorities to use the tools at their disposal. But governments have not entirely heeded the call. In the U.S., for example, Republicans and Democrats are deadlocked over a new coronavirus relief package. Speaking at Bloomberg’s forum were three former central bank chiefs—Janet Yellen of the Fed, Raghuram Rajan of the Reserve Bank of India, and Mervyn King of the Bank of England—and Lawrence Summers, who was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. Moderating was Stephanie Flanders, a Bloomberg News senior executive editor and head of Bloomberg Economics. If you like head shots of economists sitting in front of bookcases, this is  the video for you. Yellen, who went first, got  right to the point, that “monetary policy has its limits” and that fiscal relief is “essential.” (Fiscal policy covers spending and taxation, vs. monetary policy, which involves interest rates.) King said, “We have to get away from the idea that if anything goes wrong, central banks have to step in and throw money at the problem.” Rajan, the only one of the four to focus on the problems of emerging markets, said, “There is no global leadership right now. Hopefully it will emerge.” And Summers, who has breathed life into the Depression-era notion of “secular stagnation,” said the mistake for central bankers is “to vastly exaggerate their continuing relevance.” Now that central bankers in the rich, industrialized nations have already pushed interest rates about as low as they can possibly go, he said, they lack “the capacity to provide meaningful impetus to their economies.” “The deep macro problem is that savings are exceeding the natural level of private investment,” Summers said. By accounting convention total savings must equal total investment, so when desired savings is greater than desired investment, something’s got to give. One of Summers’s preferred solutions is for the government to pick up the slack by increasing public investment, such as construction and repair of infrastructure. Since central banks can whipsaw financial markets with the merest hint of an increase or decrease in interest rates, it’s easy to believe that central bankers are too powerful. In some ways, perhaps, they are. But central bankers themselves are all too aware of what they can’t accomplish.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to resume talks on a stimulus package, while McConnell stuck to his insistence on a targeted package. “We write to request that you join us at the negotiating table this week so that we can work towards a bipartisan, bicameral Covid-19 relief agreement,” Pelosi and Schumer wrote. They said they were encouraged by McConnell’s comments after Election Day calling for stimulus and saying “it’s a possibility we will do more for state and local governments” -- one of the key areas of disagreement.

As soon as London’s first coronavirus lockdown ended last summer, Abbie Sheppard, 24, took a quick vacation to the island of Bermuda.Four months later, the vacation is long over but she’s still there -- one of the thousands of people lured to islands in the Caribbean and the North Atlantic by programs aimed at snagging remote workers.“I just never went back,” Sheppard, the chief of staff at the celebrity-booking company Cameo, said by telephone. With traditional tourism hammered by the pandemic and many in Europe and North America working from home amid shorter days and dropping temperatures, islands across the Caribbean are trying to attract longer-term visitors. It’s the sun-kissed version of the road-tripping and temporary-rental trend seen over the summer.Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Aruba, Puerto Rico, and St. Kitts and Nevis are among those wooing home-bound toilers from abroad. This is distinct from pandemic promotions by some islands to sell second passports at a discount.

Intel and AMD said chips with the new technology, which Microsoft is calling Pluton, will be ready within the next few years. Qualcomm Inc. expressed support for the approach, but declined to say whether it would incorporate this specific design in its chips. Microsoft and the chip companies for years have been seeking ways to bolster computer protection by locking important information like passwords and security certificates in hardware, making it tougher for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in one computer program or part of a device and use that weakness to take over an entire machine.The Microsoft design will be directly embedded on the main computer processor, which makes it harder to hack PCs and laptops, and will offer more consistency in PC security if the technology is widely used. The advantage that on-chip security offers over software-based protection is that physical access to the machine is usually required to hack in, compared with the risk of a remote attack via the internet. That’s become even more important during the Covid-19 pandemic, because many company employees are working remotely on home hardware rather than operating behind corporate firewalls.

U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is planning new large-scale expenditures on cloud computing with Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services unit. The deal, slated for early 2021, could could reignite tensions within the companies, where groups of employees have objected to working with agencies that have presided over family separations and raids targeting undocumented immigrants.  ICE officials are in the market for “cloud infrastructure hosting in AWS and Microsoft Azure environments,” according to a Homeland Security Department website listing upcoming contracting opportunities. The agency is looking for a third-party contractor to manage its existing systems stored in AWS and Microsoft cloud computing infrastructure, as well as to expand its access to new cloud services offered by both companies.

Taiwanese and Hong Kong activists expressed alarm over reports that China was compiling a global watch list of those who have voiced views deemed separatist, a move that would mark a major escalation in Beijing’s pursuit of its critics. China is gathering names of prominent advocates of Taiwanese independence, Beijing-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported earlier this week. The list could include activists both in Taiwan and abroad as well as those who helped fund such activities, Ta Kung Pao said, citing officials it didn’t name. The newspaper is among the publishing operations controlled by China’s government through its Hong Kong Liaison Office.

It’s just suffered its biggest economic slump since the Great Depression, its border is closed and unemployment is rising, but New Zealand’s housing market is booming. Undeterred by the recession, buyers are rushing to take advantage of the record-low borrowing costs delivered by the central bank as it seeks to reflate the economy. House prices, which had been expected to drop during the pandemic, have instead surged to fresh record highs. The average price rose an annual 8% in October to NZ$753,000 ($519,800), the fastest gain in more than three years, while sales soared 25% from a year earlier in the busiest month since 2016.

California has no comprehensive approach to building affordable housing and its mismanagement resulted in the loss of $2.7 billion of bond-issuing authority that could have gone toward preventing more residents falling into homelessness, according to a report from state Auditor Elaine Howle released Tuesday. While the state has four agencies providing financial support to housing developers, their requirements are “misaligned and inconsistent, which results in an unnecessarily cumbersome process,” the audit said. It called for the elimination of a debt committee chaired by Treasurer Fiona Ma that allocates the state’s limited bond capacity.

Judy Shelton’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board was blocked in the Senate Tuesday, a stunning setback for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a blow to President Donald Trump’s drive to shake up the U.S. central bank before he leaves office. After Covid-19 exposure forced two Republican senators into quarantine, the GOP was left short of the votes needed to overcome united Democratic opposition. McConnell switched his vote to no once the outcome became clear, a tactical move that would allow him to bring the nomination up for reconsideration. That could happen as soon as this week if one of the two quarantining senators can return.

A spike in coronavirus infections through the U.S. holiday shopping season could trigger more bankruptcies from retailers, even after the biggest surge in Chapter 11 filings on record this year. Retail businesses, already squeezed by changing consumer habits and the rise of online behemoths like Amazon and Walmart.com, are required to follow state and federal regulations to curb the spread of the virus during what’s normally the busiest buying period of the year. After the traditional Black Friday and Christmas shopping sprees, some may opt to file for bankruptcy if they don’t bring in enough cash to survive.

While President Donald Trump’s campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani was claiming in a Pennsylvania federal court hearing that Democrats conspired to block Republican poll observers from monitoring ballot counts for fraud, the state’s supreme court dealt that argument a powerful blow. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Republican poll observers were not entitled to stand within a certain distance to observe the counting of ballots. The campaign and other Republicans have premised their most extravagant claims of voter fraud on the idea that Republican observers were kept too far away to properly monitor ballot-counting.

One of the biggest challenges to delivering a promising coronavirus vaccine based on unprecedented technology to millions around the world just got easier. When Pfizer Inc. announced effective preliminary results for its vaccine candidate last week, the downside was that it must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, posing significant logistical issues. But Moderna Inc. on Monday one-upped its rival, offering a vaccine based on the same technology that appears to be equally effective, but which also can be stored at regular refrigerated temperatures for up to a month.

Home Depot Inc. shares declined after the home-improvement retailer reported higher costs and a plan to spend $1 billion to boost annual compensation for front-line hourly employees. While same-store revenue, a key gauge of performance for retailers, rose 24% in the quarter ended Nov. 1, that also brought higher expenses. Cost of sales, a measure of what the company spends to generate each sale, was up 24% from a year ago, according to the statement. Part of that is due to protective gear for associates and constant cleaning of the stores.
12.05.2020
Walmart Inc. reported another solid quarter as consumers turned to the essential retailer for groceries, home goods and more. But it’s what executives didn’t say that left Wall Street uneasy. The world’s largest retailer wouldn’t provide a full-year forecast and executives offered only generalities on its much-touted subscription service, Walmart+, despite repeated attempts from analysts on a conference call to get more. Walmart also said it’s still struggling to stock key items such as bath tissue and cleaning supplies.

France‘s second lockdown will push the economy back into a slump and slow the recovery in 2021, even though restrictions to contain the coronavirus aren’t as severe as earlier in the year. In a best-case scenario of restrictions ending Dec. 1 and a quick return to the levels of activity seen just before the second lockdown, output would still drop 2.5%, statistics agency Insee said Tuesday. If activity remains at November’s levels through December, the contraction could be as deep as 6%.

There’s a tug of war taking place in the $20 trillion Treasuries market between traders taking heart from progress toward a coronavirus vaccine and those monitoring a resurgence in infections. Even after U.S. yields climbed last week to their highest level since March, expectations for a pick-up in inflation off the back of an inoculation-induced economic rebound remain muted. The bond selloff looks mostly done for Barclays Plc, while ING Groep NV anticipates a pullback in yields driven by renewed demand for the safety of government debt.

Ray Dalio said Tuesday that he might be missing something about Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency passed $17,000 for the first time in almost three years. “It’s not very good as a store-hold of wealth because its volatility is great and has little correlation with the prices of what I need to buy,” the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates said in a series of posts on Twitter, adding that governments could eventually outlaw it if it started to compete with the currencies they control.

The credit default shock waves rippling through China are hurting demand for sovereign bonds, with market watchers seeing the slide lasting the rest of 2020. China’s 10-year government notes are set to drop for a seventh month in November, on track for the longest retreat since 2007. The decline has pushed the benchmark yield to 3.32%, set for the highest since May 2019. A technical indicator suggests the bonds are facing the worst selling pressure in a year.

Banco Santander SA is planning to sit out the wave of banking mergers sweeping its home market of Spain, opting instead to expand its digital platform. “We’re not about to participate in any, let’s say, traditional bank consolidation,” Chairman Ana Botin said in a panel discussion at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Tuesday. “We don’t believe that is the right thing for us at the moment. We’re much more likely to continue buying technology platforms or add-on acquisitions.”

Business groups urged Canada’s premiers to be more coherent and transparent in their response to the coronavirus as provinces lay down a patchwork of new restrictions to stem a second wave of infections. The groups, which include the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada, said Canadians get “far too many conflicting messages” about masks and social gatherings. People would be more likely to comply if they understood the details behind the decisions, they said.

The majority of fund managers around the world are not measuring racial diversity within their staff, risking capital flows from socially-focused investors, research by pension consultancy Redington showed. Some 56% of firms surveyed said they do not collect data on race among their employees, according to a poll of more than 100 asset managers with $1 trillion in total assets. Of the managers that do, 52% have no Black investment team members, the survey said.

U.S. household debt rose slightly in the third quarter, reaching the highest level ever as record-low interest rates continue to fuel a surge in home loan borrowing among consumers with excellent credit. Total debt increased 0.6% to $14.35 trillion from $14.27 trillion in the second quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report published Tuesday. The gain was led by a surge in new mortgage loans, mostly refinancings, which reached $1.05 trillion, the second highest in data going back to 2003 and rivaling the historic refinance boom 17 years ago.

South Africa’s insolvent national arms company wants to fire about 10% of its workers in a bid to survive after the government spurned its plea for a bailout. Denel SOC Ltd., whose predecessor was established to bypass sanctions against the apartheid regime, has told 379 workers in its artillery, ammunition and armored-car divisions that they could lose their jobs, according to Helgard Cronje, a representative of labor union Solidarity. The so-called section 189 notice sent to the employees is a legal step needed before cuts can take place.

In a matter of days, America’s long effort to revive its virus-battered economy has been put on pause -- or thrown into reverse -- as new infections soar at the fastest pace since the pandemic’s earliest days. California on Monday reinstituted bans on many indoor businesses, and its governor warned he may impose a curfew. Michigan has ordered a three-week partial shutdown, while states including Oregon, Washington and New Jersey tightened curbs. Even the governor of Iowa, long resistant to virus rules, issued a limited mask mandate Monday. The new restrictions follow a rapid surge in cases -- with the country adding a million infections in the first 10 days of November alone -- that has led health officials to issue dire warnings about the prospect of uncontrollable outbreaks as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches. In a call with governors on Monday, Deborah Birx, a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, said the increase is showing no signs of a plateau and that nursing homes, in particular, are being hard-hit. “The whole country is on fire,” said Ellie Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health. “Since people can be infectious before they have symptoms, a lot of people right now are infectious and transmitting to people and don’t know it. We’re trying to get a grip on this large explosion.” Vice President Mike Pence told governors during a video conference Monday that the government had 20,000 hospital beds available around the country to handle patients, and that states had 13,000 more, according to a summary provided by Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s office. About 149,000 new cases were reported that day, according to the Covid Tracking Project. The nation’s average new-case count for the past seven days has jumped 37%, according to Johns Hopkins University data, the fastest at any point in the U.S. since late March. Pennsylvania has seen a 14% jump in total cases, while Ohio’s have surged 19%, Washington state’s climbed 11% and Illinois’s are up 18%. Michigan’s cases have increased 20%, the most since April. And in California, the number of new cases spotted each day surged more than 51% during the first week of November, according to the state -- faster than the 39% increase it endured during its last coronavirus wave in June. “The rate of increase is simply without precedent in California,” Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday during a briefing. “Every age group, every demographic -- racial, ethnic -- in every part of this state, we are seeing case rates increase.” The state, home to about 40 million residents, enacted tight restrictions on counties totaling 94% of its population, including shutting indoor dining, gyms, places of worship and theaters. Due to the alarming increases we are seeing in #COVID19 cases, CA is pulling an emergency brake.To slow the spread, 41 counties —94% of California’s population —will now be in purple, the most restrictive tier. On the White House task force call with governors, Birx said many states hit by the summer’s coronavirus surge saw case counts level off after 30 days, but that hasn’t happened this time. Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said infections have sharply increased among nursing-home patients since October, and controlling spread at the facilities is a priority, according to the summary. Infections aren’t isolated to a few geographic regions, as they were in earlier stages of the pandemic. They are rising simultaneously in urban and rural areas alike, in the Midwest and the South, as well as the east and west coasts. “This thing is spreading like wildfire all across the country,” Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said during a Monday news conference. He said he would issue new restrictions on Wednesday if infection rates don’t drop, although he didn’t say what they would be. “I don’t want to ever see a refrigeration truck coming into the state because we need it for our lost loved ones,” Beshear said. Businesses that have already endured lockdowns and restrictions on how they operate face the prospect of even more disruption. Barry Gutin, a co-founder of Cuba Libre, a Philadelphia restaurant that will mark 20 years in December, said losses already were piling up with capacity restricted to 50%. On Monday, the city said it would ban indoor dining, as well as close performance spaces, gyms and libraries. Gutin called it “another gut punch which will make it much more difficult.” His company, GuestCounts Hospitality, with restaurants in Orlando, Atlantic City and Washington, D.C., received paycheck-protection loans, and staff benefited from unemployment funds with $600-a-week federal supplements. That’s gone now, he said, and “it’s going to take governmental action” to keep the industry afloat. “Right now we’re living on borrowings and my partner’s and my savings,” Gutin said. “Our job is to find ways to lose less money.” In New York, bars and restaurants with state liquor licenses now must close at 10 p.m., along with gyms, and indoor gatherings must be limited to 10 people. Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday he will enact more restrictions if cases continue to rise. He has already shut schools and nonessential businesses in several hot spots. In New York City, officials are prepared to close schools if its citywide rate of positive tests reaches a seven-day average of 3%. As of Monday, it stood at 2.77%. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy cut the state’s indoor gathering limit to 10 people from 25 starting Tuesday, and outdoor gatherings to 150 from 500 starting Nov. 23. In recent days, the state has had its first- and second-highest daily counts since the outbreak’s first wave hit it in March. WATCH: Murphy announces further restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings after daily cases reached a record over the weekend. Source: Bloomberg) Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan warned that closing local casinos would have a major impact, because they account for a large chunk of the city’s revenue. But he said he would enforce the state’s new restrictions regardless. “The budget is not my first concern right now,” Duggan said at a news conference Monday. “We had 50 to 60 people per day die in April. Right now I just want to protect the people of the city of Detroit. We’ll deal with the budget later.” — With assistance by Stacie Sherman, Nic Querolo, Alexander Ebert, and Dina Bass

Howard Marks, the dean of distressed-debt investing who turned bullish within days of the sector’s 2020 low, is back to a cautious stance now that the ensuing rally has whittled attractive targets down to pre-pandemic levels. “When the level of optimism is high, there is usually more room for disappointment,” Marks, the co-founder of Oaktree Capital Group, said in a Tuesday telephone interview. “The main way to achieve high returns in a low-return world is through taking increased risk. And I don’t think this is the climate to take more risk.”

China’s surging economy is set to overtake 56 countries in the world’s per-capita income rankings during the quarter-century through 2025, the International Monetary Fund projects.By that date, China will rank 70th in the world on the metric, putting it close to joining the richest one-third of nations, according to data analyzed by Bloomberg from last month’s IMF World Economic Outlook. The Asian powerhouse is forecast to have per-capita GDP, adjusted for purchasing power, equal to $25,307 in 2025. That will take it past Argentina, one of the richest countries in the world a century ago and now mired in debt and currency crises.Jim O’Neill, the former head of Global Economic Research at Goldman Sachs Inc. who famously  created the BRICs acronym for Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2001, says that bloc “could become collectively bigger than the G-7 countries” in the 2030s, referring to the Group of Seven richest nations. “This is almost exclusively because of China, and to a smaller degree India,” he says.

Human baseball fans weren’t allowed to attend the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks game on July 7, but that didn’t keep a collection of humanoid robots from supporting the home team with a peppy fight song while 20 mechanical dogs in baseball uniforms bopped along in unison. The canines were made by Boston Dynamics, and their performance perfectly illustrated the conundrum the company has faced since its founding almost three decades ago: It’s created what may be the world’s most technologically sophisticated—and expensive—parlor trick. Boston Dynamics has long represented the cutting edge of robotics in popular culture, captivating YouTube audiences with the fluid movements of its animal- and human-like machines. It’s had bouts of profitability over its 28 years of existence, but recently has been losing millions of dollars a year, vexing SoftBank Group Corp., as it did its previous owner, Google. SoftBank is now preparing to sell it to Hyundai Motor Co. for about  $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. The deal isn’t complete and would require approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Hyundai and SoftBank declined to comment, and a spokeswoman would only say that Boston Dynamics “continues to excite partners interested in exploring a deeper commercial relationship with our company.” Boston Dynamics also recently changed its longtime leader and hired its first head of sales. Chief Executive Officer Rob Playter is a former collegiate gymnast who wrote his PhD thesis on techniques for teaching robots to do somersaults. In an October interview, he said SoftBank was looking for profits. “While they want us to be a disciplined and commercial company, the actual direction of the company they are leaving to us,” he says. “Pressure? Sure, there’s pressure.” Playter became CEO late last year, replacing Marc Raibert, who founded Boston Dynamics in 1992. It was an outgrowth of his academic work on walking robots at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Under Raibert’s leadership, the company developed an increasingly impressive series of machines that moved in smooth, eerily lifelike ways. Many were funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other arms of the U.S. military. In 2012, Boston Dynamics developed a robot called Cheetah that, along with its successor WildCat, could run faster than Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. Another, called Atlas, resembled a person in an astronaut’s suit and could perform backflips. Google purchased Boston Dynamics in 2013 and cut short the company’s military contracting work to focus on research and development. Owning the company cost Google about $50 million annually, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Those losses began to wear on Google when Andy Rubin, its biggest internal champion of robotics, left in 2014 following an allegation of sexual misconduct. Google started shedding unprofitable businesses the following year and sold Boston Dynamics to SoftBank, a famously deep-pocketed tech investor, in 2017. The price wasn’t disclosed at the time, but two people familiar with the matter say SoftBank paid about $165 million. Because of the potential military applications, the sale needed approval from Cfius. The agency stipulated that executives at the Japanese conglomerate couldn’t hire or fire management, direct the product road map, or have access to Boston Dynamics’s intellectual property, according to people familiar with the matter. By then the machines had started to seep into popular culture. In 2017 the popular Netflix show Black Mirror debuted an episode featuring robot dogs trying to hunt down people in a postapocalyptic world; creator Charlie Brooker later said it was inspired by Boston Dynamics videos. The company’s latest robotic dog model, Spot, has also become a YouTube sensation. In one 2018 clip with more than 60 million views, one of the yellow, four-legged machines is thwarted by the knob as it tries to open a door. Another version of Spot, this one equipped with a mechanical hand, turns the handle, and the pair pass through. Although the robots trot along amiably enough in the video, many viewers likened it to a scene from Jurassic Park in which velociraptors learn to open doors, to terrifying effect. Boston Dynamics joined a disparate collection of robotics ventures in SoftBank’s portfolio, including developers of robots for warehouses, restaurants, and other industrial applications. Its staff tripled, to 300 people, and it has moved into new headquarters in a refurbished former postal building in Waltham, Mass., at a cost of $20 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. But paying for the robot company’s operations cost SoftBank upwards of $150 million annually, one person familiar with the matter says. SoftBank’s appetite to bankroll flashy, money-losing businesses was weakened last year when one of its biggest investments, the coworking startup WeWork, saw its planned initial public offering theatrically  crash and burn. The pressure on Boston Dynamics increased further with economic strain related to the  Covid-19 pandemic. Late last year, SoftBank made a new push to steer the robot maker toward profitability, accelerating an effort that had started under Google. With SoftBank’s encouragement, Boston Dynamics promoted Playter, who had been its chief operating officer, and hired its first head of sales from Honeywell International Inc. The move wasn’t mandated by SoftBank, Playter says, describing the changes as a logical development after years of internally funded R&D under Google. “Since the SoftBank acquisition and with the maturation of the Spot robot, the company has resumed commercialization of our technologies,” he says. The billion-dollar price tag would be justified largely by progress on applications like these. Last month the company played host to 800 virtual attendees at its first customer and developer conference. The event focused on its robots’ potential to do more than delight and terrify YouTube viewers. Videos showed Spot conducting dangerous power plant inspections of pipes, monitoring a thermal exhaust treatment facility, and taking temperatures of Covid-infected patients at a Boston hospital. Some of these things are already happening. The company has sold about 400 of the machines, which start at $75,000 each, bringing in at least $30 million in revenue. Architectural giant Foster + Partners is testing out a Spot robot topped with a scanner to track progress at building sites. The robot is safer than the drones the company has tried for the same tasks, has longer battery life, and elicits more favorable reactions from human staffers, according to Foster partner Adam Davis. These capabilities are impressive but hardly unique to Boston Dynamics, says Remy Glaisner, a Boston-based robotics analyst at International Data Corp. “The applications they are right now displaying, it’s not just that there are other types of robots that do that, and probably do that much better,” he says. “It’s more about, ‘Could those robots do something we haven’t thought of yet?’ ” Playter says he’s most excited about a robot called Handle, which Boston Dynamics won’t release for sale for two years. Handle, which spins adroitly on two large wheels, is designed to automate tasks like moving boxes on and off pallets and perhaps even unloading boxes from trucks, a notoriously tough task for a robot. These may be the kinds of unglamorous tasks the company focuses on if the sale to Hyundai goes through. But the carmaker, which has experimented with ideas for walking cars, could also have an interest in the company’s quadruped technology. The robotics industry’s lack of an obvious leader leaves room for Boston Dynamics robots to mature into more than automated baseball fans, according to Glaisner. “There’s no Google of the robotics industry,” he says. —With Kyunghee Park Read next:  Honeywell Takes Tiny Steps Toward a Quantum Leap in Computing

Singapore is concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and hopes the financial hub could “settle down to a new normal,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. “We watch carefully and with some concern what’s happening in Hong Kong,” Lee said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the New Economy Forum. “That something was going to happen -- was very much on the cards -- and could not have been avoided because the demonstrations and the expressions of defiance could not have carried on indefinitely, certainly not to the end of ‘one country, two systems’ in 2047.” Lee’s comments came after China’s top legislative body last week passed a resolution allowing for the disqualification of any Hong Kong lawmakers deemed insufficiently loyal. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government immediately disqualified four legislators, prompting the remaining 15 opposition members in the 70-seat Legislative Council to resign. Lee Hsien Loong Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg The loyalty resolution was the latest move by China to stifle dissent and debate in the former British colony in the wake of pro-democracy protests that rocked the city last year. That included the enactment of sweeping national security legislation, which raised concerns about the city’s future as a global business hub and prompted the U.S. to sanction top Chinese and Hong Kong officials. Lee said he hoped China could deal with Hong Kong “in a way which would deal with a problem, but not shake confidence, and maintain the Hong Kong system intact so that it can be valuable to China and can be part of the prosperity in the region.” The New Economy Forum is organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. — With assistance by Faris Mokhtar

Monitoring Covid-19 vaccines for safety issues will fall to a group of U.S. health agencies that also will have a hand in their rollout, a potential hurdle in persuading skeptics to get the shots, say former government officials who helped control an outbreak a decade ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other health agencies all have separate systems to track side effects and safety in people who get the first shots. But there are concerns the groups advising the agencies on all aspects of a vaccine may face public skepticism over their safety assessments at a time when vaccine hesitancy is a major concern.

Paris (AP) -- Tens of thousands of critics of a proposed security law that would restrict the filming of police officers protested across France on Saturday, and officers in Paris who were advised to behave responsibly during the demonstrations repeatedly fired tear gas to disperse rowdy protesters who set fire to France's central bank and threw paving stones. The mood was largely peaceful, however, as dozens of rallies took place against a provision of the law that would make it a crime to publish photos or video of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their “physical or psychological integrity.”

Since August, a steady stream of cars has been pulling into a parking lot next to a downtown Spokane office building. Passengers get out to snap masked selfies in front of a freshly painted Black Lives Matter mural, with each letter filled in by a different local artist.  It’s a scenario that would have been hard to envision in June, when self-proclaimed militia members dotted Spokane’s downtown streets in response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations. “The sheer outpouring of support was beyond anything I could have ever imagined,” says Ginger Ewing, executive director of the arts nonprofit Terrain, who spearheaded the mural project. “I’m watching people take 45 minutes or an hour going to each letter, having conversations — parents talking with their kids. I actually think that post-pandemic it’s going to continue to be a gathering space for people to come and have necessary, hard conversations.” The impact of the mass movement against racial injustice that swept the U.S. after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd in May is just beginning to be seen and felt in policy changes and election results. But the movement has already left vivid physical marks on cities, via a wave of street art: Since a now-iconic mural dedicated to Floyd appeared on a wall near the Minneapolis street corner where he was killed, racial justice-themed paintings, messages and portraits proliferated in towns and cities across the United States, and beyond. Tributes to George Floyd emerged in places as far-flung as Karachi, Pakistan; Idlib, Syria; Nairobi, Kenya; and Athens, Greece.  Among the most influential works from these protests: The 50-foot, visible-from-space yellow letters spelling “Black Lives Matter” that Washington D.C., painted on the asphalt near Lafayette Square, just hours after the Trump administration used tear gas to clear protesters in June. That act inspired scores of  similar  pop-up road murals bearing similar messages in scores of cities, including downtown Raleigh, Tulsa’s historic Greenwood district and all five boroughs of New York City. In Nevada, “Black Lives Matter” was spelled out in tire tracks across four miles in Black Rock Desert, close to the Burning Man site. Particularly poignant is the mural that Prairie View A&M University students created under the supervision of the School of Architecture’s dean, Ikhlas Sabouni. It marks the stretch of road where police arrested Sandra Bland, a Black woman, in 2015 during a pretextual traffic stop. She was later found hanged in her jail cell.   The explosion of racial justice street art in the U.S. is part of the larger surge in murals and public art that have marked global cities transformed by the coronavirus pandemic. “There’s been more demand throughout Covid and Black Lives Matter [protests], which has opened up more spaces and led to more excitement,” says street artist and entrepreneur Evan Meyer, who founded Beautify, a Santa Monica-based technology company that offers an Airbnb-style platform to connect artists with community organizers and property owners nationally. The tool streamlines the logistics of executing beautification projects, allowing building owners to swiftly find muralists-for-hire. That’s proved useful in recent months in cities rocked by protests and lockdowns, both of which left retail districts in some cities  marred with large expanses of plywood-covered windows in need of quick, socially uplifting decoration. Recently, the U.S. presidential electionand its tense aftermath brought a spate of political art with voting-themed messages.  “We were able to be super-responsive to the needs of communities, whether that was painting boarded-up storefronts or providing tools and resources to organizations so they could activate projects and get more done,” says Meyer. “People understand they can use street art as a way to tell a story and it can become a historical element, a cultural piece. You have a choice to live in an environment that’s boring and bland, or to use our spaces to reflect who we are as people, especially during these important points in history.” Street messages are more than just symbolic gestures, says Milwaukee-based Nicolas Lampert, an artist and author of A People’s Art History of the United States: 250 Years of Activist Art and Artists Working in Social Justice Movements. “When you put up a mural, it amplifies community voices and amplifies the power of mass movements,” says Lampert, a member of Voces de los Artistas, an art affinity group with the immigrant rights center Voces de la Frontera. He recently helped organize a 275-foot-long mural in support of voting rights Milwaukee’s Historic Mitchell Street. “Public space is so important because it’s contested. And it’s commodified. The traditional ways people see visual messages is through billboards and spaces that cost money. When artists put up murals, they create an essential space for people to take in not just the views of powerful corporations, but the voices of artists and ordinary people. With the explosion of art after the tragic killing of George Floyd, people are putting up murals because they’re outraged. They’re saying ‘enough is enough’ and they’re expressing that through art.” “A mural can make a street corner into a social hotspot.” There is a deep-seated legacy of artists harnessing the collaborative power of public art and image-making to mobilize communities. In “The Power of the Urban Canvas: Paint, Politics, and Mural Art in Policy,” published in the New England Journal of Public Policy, Maura E. Greaney investigates how urban mural programs evolved from impromptu political protest in Black and Latino communities in the 1960s. Perhaps most famously, the era’s civil unrest gave rise to the Wall of Respect, a “guerrilla mural” depicting more that 50 African-American figures painted in 1967 on a building in Chicago’s Grand Boulevard neighborhood. Before that, politically tinged murals and other public art were fixtures of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. The fact that art can document and inspire speaks to the importance of public spaces as critical infrastructure. As Matthew Clarke, executive director of the Design Trust for Public Space in New York City, points out, outdoor gathering places can serve as a nexus for public health and mental health. “Racism has been a persistent trauma in the American story for hundreds of years. That trauma is embedded in communities, neighborhoods and individuals,” he says. “There are ways to address trauma, and murals and public art are wonderful ways to do so. In times of national crisis or trauma, the need for free and creative expression is amplified.” Not all public art brings messages of social justice, of course. In an intensely polarized nation, they also serve as stages for America’s fractious political conversation. In 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 780 monuments honoring the Confederacy, most erected during the Jim Crow era as expressions of white supremacy. Less than three months since George Floyd’s death,  38 monuments were removed, the SPLC says, and many others have been targeted with anti-racist graffiti and vandalism. In response to the “Black Lives Matter” imagery, conservatives have countered different messages. In New York, pro-police groups that proposed a “Blue Lives Matter” mural filed a lawsuit against Mayor Bill de Blasio for rejecting the request. Tampa’s “Back the Blue” road mural, painted without a permit in August in front of police department headquarters, was defaced within days.  A similar face-off over street art gripped the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, site of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. Community members painted a Black Lives Matter street mural on Greenwood Avenue on the eve of President Donald Trump’s June rally in that city. Early in August, the mural was vandalized with blue paint, and in October the city voted to remove it, citing objections from nearby property owners and potential distraction for drivers.  In Kansas City, Missouri, the city partnered with the local NAACP chapter and Urban League of Greater Kansas City to create six BLM street murals, totaling 2,000 linear feet, in different neighborhoods over the course of a weekend in September. When one 400-foot mural in Briarwood, an affluent neighborhood, was defaced with tire marks, the artist, Harold Smith, insisted on using it as a teaching moment. “He said if this isn’t a testament to why the mural has to be there, he didn’t know what else is,” says Crissy Dastrup, legislative aide to Kansas City Councilman Eric Bunch and cofounder of Troost Market Collective, a local arts nonprofit. Dastrup oversaw the mural projects and also organized what became known as Operation Clapback to repaint and repair the tire-damaged Briarwood mural: Locals were provided with stencils and a range of flesh-toned spray paints to leave multi-hued handprints and other messages on the street.  The final product telegraphs a we-will-not-be-defeated message, Dastrup says. “We weren’t going to go away with our tail between our legs; we were going to amplify what the vandals did, because this is exactly why we’re doing this project. It was about bringing the community together to get at something important.” When the community gathered, the mural fix took on a festive event-like air. That, too, is a product of public art-making, says Beautify’s Meyer.  “A mural can make a street corner into a social hotspot,” says Meyer. “With everything happening these days, there’s a lack of joy and hope. But communities are rebuilding themselves by telling local stories and, at the same time, making beautiful art for people to smile at. Healing comes from the realization that there’s still color, joy and beauty all around.”

Inflation in Canada unexpectedly picked up in October, partly on the back of rising home ownership costs. Annual inflation accelerated to 0.7%, from 0.5% in September, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday in Ottawa. That exceeded the 0.4% anticipated by economists in a Bloomberg survey. An index of replacement costs for homeowners rose by the most in 30 years last month, the agency said.

New Zealand’s central bank said it accidentally disclosed sensitive information from its latest Monetary Policy Statement to a group of financial services firms before the official publication time last week. The information was in a letter sent to non-bank financial institutions 45 minutes before the release of the policy statement at 2 p.m. on Nov. 11 in Wellington, the Reserve Bank said in a statement Wednesday. The letter confirmed the RBNZ’s decision to introduce a new round of monetary stimulus in the form of a Funding for Lending Program, but did not contain specifics, it said.

(AP) -- A lot of the effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus comes down to a seemingly simple concept: Wearing a mask. But the issue has proven a thorny one. Health authorities have changed their guidance on who should wear masks and when to wear them. This has led to some confusion and even suspicion. But since the coronavirus first appeared, authorities have gained a better understanding of how it spreads and how masks can help stop that spread. Here's a look at how what we know about masks has changed, and how government officials are increasingly getting behind the idea of mandating the use of masks. WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has long advised people to wear masks because they help prevent people who are infected — whether they know it or not — from spreading the coronavirus. But last week, the CDC added a new reason: masks can also protect wearers who are not infected, though to a lesser degree. The agency referred to a study led by Japanese researchers that found masks block about 60% of the amount of virus that comes out of an infected person. When an uninfected person wearing a mask is near an infected person who isn't wearing one, the amount of virus the uninfected person inhaled fell by up to 50%. But when BOTH people are wearing masks, that produced the best result. The decline in virus particles reaching the second person was close to 70%. So, if everyone wears a mask when social distancing is not feasible, the infection rate will be cut, experts say. A study done in Denmark, published Wednesday in Annals of Internal Medicine, seemed to question whether and to what extent masks protect the wearer. The study had a number of flaws, however, as the researchers acknowledged. For example, study participants who were supposed to wear masks sometimes didn’t. And the work was done at a time when not much coronavirus was spreading in Denmark – meaning there wasn’t a lot of data to draw conclusions from. Either way, experts say masks, while helpful, are not perfect. Keeping a distance, being in well-ventilated areas, and washing hands are also important ways to reduce risk. HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY'VE SAID BEFORE? U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted on Feb. 29: “Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus" But today, Adams has a different message pinned to the top of his Twitter account. “When we can't stay six feet away from others, please, I'm begging you, wear a face covering,” Adams says in the videotaped July 2 tweet. And in July, the CDC stressed that cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19, particularly when everyone wears them. Similarly, the World Health Organization early on had recommended against mask-wearing for the general public, saying they might lead to a false sense of security and that people who didn’t know how to use them properly could infect themselves. The World Health Organization changed its advice in June, and now says people should wear them when they can’t be socially distant. WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ON MASKS? In the United States, there are none. The CDC has made only recommendations. And the attitude from the White House has been casual at best. Before the election, President Donald Trump often ridiculed his then Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, for wearing one whenever he was out in public. The president also held rallies that brought together thousands of supporters, most of them not wearing masks. Biden, now president-elect, has said repeatedly that there should be a nationwide mask mandate. He has also promised to ask every governor to impose mask rules. For those who refuse, he’s vowed to go around them to seek similar mandates at the county or local level until the entire country is covered. Some other countries have already mandated mask use, from requiring them everywhere in public to using them on public transportation and in stores. HOW ARE U.S. STATES HANDLING THE SITUATION? It's a mix. As of Tuesday, 36 states have some type of mask mandate. Republican governors in Iowa, North Dakota and Utah — all states that are being hit hard — have recently reversed course and required at least limited mask use. Others have extended or expanded earlier orders. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds cast some doubt Tuesday on the science behind masks even as she imposed a limited mask rule, noting that neighboring states with mask mandates have seen rising numbers of cases, although not as severely as Iowa. “If you look, you can find whatever you want to support wherever you are at,” she said. In California, a more stringent mask mandate took effect on Tuesday. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said residents will be required to cover up outdoors, with limited exceptions. —— AP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe contributed to this story from New York. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky

American workers and businesses face a months-long survival test until Covid-19 vaccines become widely available as spending plunges with record daily cases prompting a sudden return to lockdowns. More than 1 million U.S. virus cases were reported in the past week, leading states including Michigan, New Mexico and California to set tighter rules on movement and commerce. A wide swath of businesses -- restaurants, hotels, retail shops, bowling alleys and theaters -- will confront a devastating winter, if they are able to remain open at all. Many workers face the holidays with food and shelter in doubt.

A lot of theories have emerged on why Bitcoin has skyrocketed almost 60% in the past month, with most heralding widespread adoption by institutions and individuals.The fact remains that there’s nothing widespread about Bitcoin ownership. A few large holders commonly referred to as whales continue to own most Bitcoin. About 2% of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain control 95% of the digital asset, according to researcher Flipside Crypto.

Target Corp.’s third-quarter sales show that pandemic-driven shopping is still surging heading into the holidays. Comparable sales including e-commerce, a critical gauge of success for retailers, jumped 20.7% from a year earlier, the retailer said Wednesday in a statement. That’s almost double the estimate of 11.6% growth from Consensus Metrix, although down from 24.3% in the second quarter. Profit and gross margin also exceeded estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

In 2020, powerful forces of change remapped all of our lives — collectively and privately, literally and metaphorically. The global Covid-19 pandemic upended the world, weaving a public health crisis together with political, economic and social upheaval. Cries for racial justice filled city streets. Floods, storms and fires fueled by climate change ravaged communities. And the virus forced us all to renegotiate how we navigate home, work and relationships. What does that look like for you? Earlier this year, we invited readers to create a map depicting life during the early throes of the pandemic. Now, we want to expand the scope of that project. We’re inviting you, our readers, to create a homemade map of your life, community, workplace or broader surroundings as you experienced them in 2020. Show us how the extraordinary changes of this year have shown up in your life. Or, try to envision how this year will impact 2021. Perhaps you want to map the city you hope to see — changes in architecture, transportation or public space — or how you imagine, hope or fear humanity might be changed due to this collectively lived experience. Your map can be as straightforward or subjective as you wish. We welcome your creativity: Any medium, as long as you can transmit it in an image file, is welcome.  To participate in this project, create your map and then answer a few questions about it via our survey form, where we also provide further details about how to submit an image of your map to us. If you participated in the first round of this project, we invite you to submit another map and tell us how life has changed since you last documented it for us.  We’ll publish a selection of these reader-submitted images and map stories on our website as part of an archival mapping project that documents the complexity of 2020 for people around the world. We are also looking for maps to include in a forthcoming book based off the project. Our goal is to feature an inclusive and diverse set of maps, so please help us expand our reach by sharing this callout with friends, family, neighbors, coworkers and classmates.  The deadline to submit your survey and map is Monday, Dec. 14, 2020. For regular updates on this project and other mapping-related news, subscribe to our newsletter, MapLab.

A Michigan county that includes Detroit reversed its decision not to certify election results amid a national uproar over an earlier vote to withhold approval, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Tuesday night. The Board of Canvassers for Wayne County, Michigan’s largest, initially split 2-2 on a vote, with the two Republican members voting against certification. But Benson said on CNN that the board voted again on Tuesday night, unanimously this time, to certify the results but also asking state officials to conduct an audit of some precincts.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be required by their regulator to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in capital to protect against losses, a step considered crucial to freeing the mortgage giants from U.S. control. The Federal Housing Finance Agency rule finalized Wednesday stipulates how much of a capital cushion the companies would have to maintain against their assets as fully private entities in order to weather a financial crisis. The combined total could exceed $280 billion, and Fannie and Freddie would likely need to sell shares and retain earnings for years to raise the funds.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said it will consider claims by President Donald Trump’s campaign that around 8,000 Philadelphia mail-in ballots should be disqualified because they weren’t filled out properly. According to the campaign, the ballots should be tossed because the voters signed but did not further hand-write their names, addresses or dates on the outside of the return envelopes. A Philadelphia court denied the campaign’s request on Friday, noting voters’ names and addresses were already pre-printed on the envelopes and that state election law was ambiguous on what it means to “fill out” ballots.

Pfizer Inc. said a final analysis of clinical-trial data showed its Covid-19 vaccine was 95% effective, paving the way for the company to apply this week for the first U.S. regulatory authorization for a coronavirus shot. The U.S. drugmaker and partner BioNTech SE said their vaccine protected people of all ages and ethnicities, with no significant safety problems so far in a trial that includes almost 44,000 participants. Pfizer shares were up 2% at 11:25 a.m. in New York, with BioNTech American depositary receipts gaining 5.3%. The update is the latest in a string of promising developments on the vaccine front in recent days. Moderna Inc.’s rival shot appears equally effective, judging from data published earlier this week, and a third contender, from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, is expected to release trial results soon. Read More: Encouraging Breakthroughs Offer Hope for Controlling Virus Pfizer and its German partner now plan a filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Friday at the latest, BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Documents have already been filed with the European Medicines Agency, which is conducting a rolling review, he said. “There are almost daily phone calls and document exchange” with the European regulator, Sahin said. “I am confident that based on the positive data we have generated today, all authorities -- the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities -- will really push to get this done as quickly as possible.” WATCH: BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin says they’ll will apply for emergency authorization in the U.S. Source: Bloomberg) The Pfizer-BioNTech data shows 170 trial participants contracted Covid-19 overall. Eight participants who got the vaccine fell ill, while 162 cases were seen among those who got the placebo. The shot helped to prevent severe disease, according to the analysis, with nine of 10 severe cases in the trial occurring in the placebo group. The vaccine’s efficacy in people older than 65 was more than 94%, the companies said. Most people who received the shot tolerated it well. Severe fatigue was seen in 3.8% of volunteers after the second dose in the two-shot regimen, and 2% of people had a severe headache after the second dose. But those were the only severe side effects that occurred in at least 2% of people, according to the data. The results “appear to confirm a highly impressive efficacy profile for the vaccine and a side-effect profile that appears very reasonable given the vaccine’s benefits,” Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a research note. Pfizer and BioNTech said last week that an initial readout showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. The news helped spark a broad stock-market rally on hopes that the shot could help control a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide. On Monday, Moderna released its own promising results and said it expects to be able to apply for emergency authorization in the U.S. within weeks.

The  billions of dollars plowed into  Covid-19 vaccines have yielded promising results in tests by Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna—welcome news in the battle against the  global outbreak. But for scientists studying another respiratory ailment known to trigger pandemics—influenza—the news is equally important, because it augurs an acceleration of their research. “What you are seeing are several technologies that will be tested all at once,” says Gregory Glenn, research chief for Novavax Inc., which is working on Covid and flu vaccines. “It’s kind of the world’s greatest technology bake-off: You’re going to see how the vaccines perform.” The influenza viruses that infect people change constantly, so twice a year—around the peak of the flu seasons in the Northern and Southern hemisphere winters—the World Health Organization makes its best guess about the strains likely to emerge the following year. Pharmaceutical companies use the information to develop vaccines and soon begin production, typically by injecting viruses into hundreds of millions of chicken eggs where they grow for a few days before extraction. After several weeks of further processing, in late summer manufacturers send the flu shots to clinics and pharmacies for distribution to patients throughout the fall.  By flu season Data: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Flu season is the fall of the year specified and the winter of the following year Some years the procedure works reasonably well; other times its performance is abysmal. Vaccines have been anywhere from 10% to 60% effective over the past 15 years, according to U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci. “Once the vaccine production process is initiated, it is nearly impossible to begin anew if a different strain emerges,” Fauci told Congress last year. The technology for incubating viruses in eggs was developed in the 1940s by an Army-backed research team co-lead by Jonas Salk, who later became famous for his polio vaccine. A drawback of the process is that viruses can mutate while they’re growing in eggs, so they don’t always offer protection from the illnesses circulating among humans. Egg-based “technology got kind of stuck in time, a victim of its own success,” says John Shiver, vaccine development chief at Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the No. 1 maker of flu shots. Some techniques being explored by Covid researchers are fundamentally different. Instead of virus proteins, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain so-called  messenger RNA, or mRNA—genetic instructions that prompt the body to produce disease-specific antigens, effectively turning it into its own vaccine factory. The technology is still new, and a successful debut against Covid would  bolster public confidence in mRNA vaccines for flu and other diseases, says Meagan Fitzpatrick, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland’s medical school. “This is going to be a huge boost,” she says. “The biggest hurdles will already have been overcome.” A second flu technology poised to get a lift from Covid research is the so-called recombinant vaccine, an idea being pursued by Novavax and Sanofi. In this process, scientists remove from the virus DNA that triggers a response from the immune system. Technicians combine the DNA with genetic material that can penetrate cells of insects such as moths, which grow proteins well and are easy to cultivate. These then produce antigens that can be harvested for use in a vaccine. A subsidiary of Sanofi signed a  $226 million deal last December with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to expand production capacity of recombinant flu vaccines at a facility in Pennsylvania. Growing fears of what some are calling a “twindemic” have sparked  record interest in flu shots this year, with almost 200 million doses available in the U.S., an increase of as much as 13% from 2019. Although not being used for Covid research, so-called cell-culture vaccines—which also avoid using eggs—are benefiting from that interest. In this approach, the virus is grown in cells originally derived from mammals, which are preferable because the virus doesn’t seek to adapt to its avian host. Australia’s CSL Ltd., the No. 2 maker of flu shots, has expanded annual production of cell-based vaccines at a North Carolina plant from 2 million doses to 30 million, and it says it will largely phase out egg-based flu vaccines in the U.S. by 2026. On Nov. 16, CSL said it will spend about $585 million on a new cell-based facility in Australia to make flu vaccines and anti-venoms for snake bites. Only a handful of companies have embraced the cell technology, which requires a lot of expertise and upfront investment. Some in the business say there’s scant reason to give up on flu prevention methods they know. While Sanofi plans to expand production of its recombinant flu vaccines, it will continue to use eggs as well. And GlaxoSmithKline Plc says eggs enable fast and inexpensive production of the millions of doses needed to make sufficient supplies every year. Still, the renewed focus on influenza and the money being spent on Covid prevention will hasten the shift away from eggs as new technologies become more widely accepted, says Leo Poon, head of public-health laboratory sciences at the University of Hong Kong. “That will definitely help develop better and more effective vaccines for other diseases,” he says. Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna, which don’t offer flu shots today, are already applying mRNA vaccines to more than just Covid. The technology “will also disrupt the flu market,” Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, said on a call with analysts in July. “We see a very large opportunity.” Read next:  Coronavirus Long Haulers Tell Us Their Symptoms and the Aftereffects of Disease

Thailand’s parliament rejected a push by pro-democracy groups for a constitutional amendment to reduce the powers of the nation’s monarchy, potentially escalating a monthslong anti-government protests. The lawmakers instead voted for setting up a charter rewriting committee that will skip any review of chapters governing the monarchy, the most powerful institution in Thailand. The roadmap for amendment proposed by a rights group, which the protesters support, failed to secure enough support from the lawmakers.

California on Wednesday reallocated $600 million of private activity bonds formerly awarded to Fortress Investment Group’s Las Vegas tourist train to affordable housing needs, a win for developers trying to ease the state’s severe shortage of homes. The company’s Brightline West venture earlier this year had received its entire request of the limited resource, as well as bonds from Nevada, and offered as much as $3.2 billion of debt leveraged from the allocations. But it failed to get enough investors on board, letting California reclaim the bonds.

House Democrats voted to stick with Nancy Pelosi as their leader and nominee for speaker, placing confidence in her to unite a fractious caucus despite surprise losses in this month’s election that have emboldened congressional Republicans. Pelosi, 80, must still win a majority of votes from the full House to remain as speaker when the new Congress begins in January. She will have a slimmer majority next year, which complicates her path to securing enough support to win the gavel on the first round of voting.

U.K. companies are turning to cheaper overseas labor to complete their post-Brexit customs paperwork, creating jobs in countries such as Romania and India due to a shortage of trained staff in Britain. Anticipating a surge in demand for its services, Xpediator Plc, which handles freight flows for international companies, has been hiring workers in Romania. Dave Gladen, the firm’s group marketing manager, says the country has a deep pool of expertise in the EU’s customs rules because it only joined the bloc in 2007.

The UAE has not said publicly it’s debating its membership, let alone planning to exit. And officials briefed the media under condition they would not be named, allowing room for maneuver if they later want to distance themselves from the comments.

Southwest Airlines Co. sent another 403 workers warnings that they could be furloughed, as the carrier struggles to shave $500 million from labor costs and avoid the first involuntary layoffs in its 49-year history. The airline expects the mechanics and other employees to be laid off in January if it can’t reach agreements with unions, according to an emailed statement Wednesday. Since seniority rights mean Southwest can’t know which individuals ultimately will be let go, it sent another 1,503 workers notice that they could be affected.

New York City’s public school shutdown and the prospect of a crippled mass transit agency brings a new sense of vulnerability to a city that had been making a comeback from its dark days as the world’s Covid-19 epicenter. And more bad news is imminent. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the city’s rising test rate could force indoor dining, gyms and some other nonessential businesses to close, and Mayor Bill de Blasio said he expects those actions to be taken “quite soon.” “The two most important things about getting back to work and getting back to normal are school and transportation,” said Jeff Blau, chief executive officer of Related Companies, the New York City-based real estate developer. “Today was a bit of a double whammy.” The moves threaten the city’s economy just as it was showing signs of improvement. Before Covid-19 struck, the city’s unemployment rate was 3.4%. New York, the early center of the U.S. outbreak, saw the rate touch a high of 20.3% in June. By September, with the reopening of schools and many businesses, it had partly recovered to 14.1%. Shares of real estate firms, lenders and other New York City-linked companies accelerated declines after de Blasio’s schools announcement. It comes as Wall Street’s biggest banks may scale back their workforce in 2021: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to cut its headcount for the second time in just three months. For the parents of hundreds of thousands of students, the crisis was immediate: They must find alternative child-care arrangements or adjust their work schedules by Thursday, after the mayor said the city had reached a 3% positivity rate that triggered the halt of at least two weeks to in-class instruction. Workers also face the prospect of longer commutes, after New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it will have to slash subways and buses by 40% and chop commuter rail service by half if aid doesn’t come from Washington. “The Covid-19 health crisis happened fast, but the economic consequences are going to roll out over time and the news is going to get worse before it starts to turn around,” said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a civic organization comprised of corporate chief executives. New York City came to a near-standstill earlier this year as Cuomo shut schools and nonessential businesses to slow the spread of Covid-19. At its peak in April, the city was reporting more than 5,000 cases a day. By August, it had controlled the spread to fewer than 300 daily cases. A recent nationwide resurgence associated with the colder weather has brought that number back up, to a seven-day average of 1,212 as of Nov. 16. “We are resolved to keep fighting,” de Blasio said Wednesday at a news briefing. “We will overcome this moment.” De Blasio had warned parents last week that schools could close as soon as Nov. 16 if the city’s average positive-test rate reached 3% over the weekend. Though the rate stayed below that threshold for days, parents were on watch for updated numbers that would trigger school closings the next day. New York City has the largest public-school system in the U.S., and its decision to offer at least some in-class instruction was watched around the nation as other districts hesitated to follow its lead. The closing forces almost 300,000 students who had been participating to join the rest of the city’s 1.1 million public-school students in all-online instruction at home. The schools’ shutdown begins days after the deadline for parents’ one chance to switch their children from all-remote to the blended program. Educators say face-to-face learning is more effective than at-home instruction, especially for younger and special-needs students. Tens of thousands remain without mobile devices and adequate broadband service, a problem school officials say may not be fixed until later in the school year.

Read More: New York MTA Warns of 40% Subway Cut, Shedding 9,300 JobsFor those living in the New York City region, mass transit is a way of life. Shopkeepers, restaurants and businesses depend on it to stay afloat. The drastic scaleback will dampen the city’s ability to lure workers from their homes and get them back into empty office buildings and move people around the city for shopping, entertainment and dining. Before the pandemic, about 59% of all workers in Manhattan used public transportation, compared with 5% in the nation as a whole, according to the U.S. Census.“Massive cuts to the MTA would have a devastating effect on New York City businesses, from offices to retail to hospitality, and undoubtedly result in more bankruptcies of both businesses and individuals,” said David Wander, a bankruptcy partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP. “With significantly reduced mass transit service, the value of having a business here is diminished, especially when you factor in the high costs of operating in the city.”The service cuts would also mean laying off 9,367 MTA employees and imposing fare and toll increases. Those changes would reverberate across the region, resulting in a $65 billion loss in gross domestic product annually for the New York City region and costing a potential 450,000 jobs by 2022, according to an NYU Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management report.The MTA may implement the service cuts and layoffs as early as May, with major changes to commuting times. Riders would pay higher fares while waiting 15 minutes on weekends for subways, see nearly a fourth of bus routes reduced and have peak-time commuter rail service cut to almost 30 minutes or even hourly. MTA’s board is set to vote on the 2021 budget, which includes the potential service and workforce changes, next month. But it was news of the schools closing that dragged down shares of New York City-linked companies. Office REITs Vornado Realty Trust, SL Green Realty Corp. and Empire State Realty Trust Inc. closed down more than 4% Wednesday. Apartment REITs Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities Inc. also lost ground and Signature Bank dropped 3.9%. Investors have been assessing rising coronavirus cases across the U.S. with positive vaccine news over the past couple of weeks, weighing on shares of technology and other companies that benefit when people stay at home. New York City-exposed stocks are reversing gains from earlier this week after positive vaccine news from Moderna Inc. added to last week’s optimism about a return to pre-pandemic city living. Read more: NYC-Linked REITs, Lenders Fall as De Blasio Closes School System The city said the decision to shut down in-person instruction was made out of caution even though the virus has been absent from most classrooms, and the infection rate from conducting tens of thousands of random tests in city schools has remained below 1%. The order doesn’t apply to the city’s private schools, some of which have been offering in-class instruction to their youngest learners. In Manhattan, Lyceum Kennedy French American School plans to remain open, according to a letter from its chief operating officer to parents. All 69 Catholic schools in Brooklyn and Queens are staying open as well, according to a Twitter post. Read more: Private Schools Chart Own Path as De Blasio Shuts NYC System De Blasio’s announcement sparked confusion, because it came shortly after Cuomo had said the city’s average positivity was 2.5%. When asked about the disparity, Cuomo said there are “complex” differentials in state and city numbers that have to do with timing. Cuomo also noted that a 3% rate calculated by the state would put New York City in a designated orange zone that would have to shut indoor dining, gyms and other “high-risk,” nonessential businesses.  New York state reported 5,294 new cases for Nov. 17, which about a third of those -- 1,747 -- in New York City. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 574,072 people in the state have tested positive for the virus. The governor, who has the authority to stop schools from shutting, said he wouldn’t interfere with a 3% threshold that was agreed upon by city officials, parents and teachers. At the same time, he urged them to consider amending their plan to factor in the schools’ infection rates as well as the city’s. Commuters wear protective masks while riding a bus in New York. Photographer: Gabriela Bhaskar/Bloomberg “If the school is not spreading the virus or if the school has a much lower positivity rate than the surrounding area, then the school is not part of the problem,” Cuomo said Nov. 14. “You could argue that keeping the children in the school is part of the solution, rather than the children spending time on the street in the neighborhood where the infection rate is higher.” Closing the schools “has ancillary consequences that people don’t often think about,” the governor said. “You close the schools, you make it much harder for parents to go to work. Now they have to worry about who’s going to take care of the children.” Schools across the U.S. have been open for weeks, and so far relatively few appear to have spread Covid-19 among students or into wider communities. So far, the schools’ experience suggests that children are not major spreaders of the virus among each other, their families and others, as had been initially feared. Instead, they are more likely accurate reflections of conditions in the broader community. “You can’t really pull the school out from the community,” said Walter Gilliam, an education policy researcher at the Yale School of Medicine. “If the transmission rates are too high, there’s just almost nothing they could do to keep it from getting into schools.” United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew, who represents the city’s more than 90,000 public school staff, said the 3% threshold was established “to make sure that schools did not become centers to spread the coronavirus.” He called on New Yorkers to observe social distancing rules, wearing masks and other steps to “lower the infection rate so school buildings can re-open.” The 3% standard is part of the schools’ multiple lines of defense including masks physical distancing and hygiene. Officials don’t have enough information to know which rule could be scrapped or modified without risking a crisis, Jay Varma, de Blasio’s senior public health adviser, said Friday in an interview. “Our standard of evidence has to be higher than a guess,” he said. “We can’t say for sure that if we remove one part of this protocol that we can absolutely guarantee everything as safe.” On Wednesday, De Blasio said the city came back from a worse situation last spring and will reopen the schools. “If it takes tougher standards, we will live by those tougher standards,” he said. “Today is a tough day, but this is a temporary situation. This disease will be beaten in the course of this school year.” — With assistance by Amanda L Gordon, Kristine Owram, Keshia Clukey, and Eliza Ronalds-Hannon

Ghana’s government has denied interfering in a probe into the creation of a gold-royalties fund following the resignation of the special prosecutor who led the investigation. Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu resigned on Nov. 16, citing interference following the conclusion of a corruption-risk assessment into the state’s new fund. His office’s report challenged the government’s choice of advisers and the mode of valuation for the fund, which had its $500-million initial public offering suspended last month.

China’s ability to keep selling more of its goods abroad means officials will be in no rush to rein in their strongest yuan in more than two years. The People’s Bank of China in November has refrained from using tools to limit the yuan’s advance, even as the currency heads for the longest run of monthly gains in six years. That’s a reversal from last month, when authorities made it cheaper to bet against the yuan and eased some control over the exchange rate, moves that were interpreted as part of Beijing’s effort to rein in appreciation.

Supporters of President Donald Trump whose claims of election fraud in Detroit and surrounding Wayne County were shot down by lower courts shouldn’t get to take their “grab-bag of falsehoods” before the Michigan Supreme Court, lawyers for the city argued. A judge rejected the lawsuit last Friday, saying affidavits claiming widespread fraud in vote counting at the TCF Center in Detroit were “rife with speculation and guess-work about sinister motives.” An appeals court also rejected the case, leading Trump backers to ask the high court to halt the certification or order an audit of the vote tally in Detroit, which heavily supported President-elect Joe Biden.

Whatever you tax, you discourage. Taxes on tobacco and alcohol discourage smoking and drinking, while taxes on gasoline discourage carbon emissions. Unfortunately those taxes hurt the poor most, since they spend a bigger portion of their income on those products. But nobody would argue that smoking, drinking, and warming the planet are things that society should be encouraging. In contrast, wireless communication is something that society wants more of. A cell phone is a lifeline in an emergency and an indispensable tool in daily life and business. For the 67% of low-income households that have no wired phone service at home, the cell phone is the only phone. Yet taxes, fees, and surcharges on cell phone service keep drifting higher. According to a study released Nov. 17 by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, “A typical American household with four phones on a ‘family share’ plan, paying $100 per month for taxable wireless service, can expect to pay about $270 per year in taxes, fees, and surcharges—up from $260 in 2019.” Taxes, fees, and surcharges make up 22.6% of the national-average bill, “the highest rate ever,” according to the Tax Foundation, which has been reporting on wireless taxes annually since 2003. For middle- and upper-income households, those extra costs are an annoyance. For the poor, they’re crushing.  Competition has pushed down the pre-tax cost of cell phone service by 26% since 2008, but subscribers haven’t enjoyed the benefit because wireless taxes have risen about 50% over the same period, the Tax Foundation says. This year, the main reason for the increase is a jump in the federal Universal Service Fund tax rate, from 9.1% to 9.8%. That’s a 9% increase in the rate on top of a 36% increase in 2019. Some of the money in that fund subsidizes low-income families’ wireless costs, but only a portion. A lot goes for building communications infrastructure in rural areas, which helps the rural poor but also rich second-home owners. This is one issue on which conservatives and liberals can make common cause. The Tax Foundation leans center-right. “Our main goal is to make sure that the tax code does not interfere in businesses’ ability to succeed and consumers’ ability to choose for themselves,” Ulrik Boesen, a Tax Foundation senior policy analyst who co-wrote the study, says in an interview. On wireless taxation, he says, “we do agree with more liberal organizations.”

Investment firm Insight Partners has acquired a majority stake in CommerceHub in a deal valuing it at $1.9 billion, according to the e-commerce company. Insight bought part of the stakes in CommerceHub that were owned by private equity firms GTCR and Sycamore Partners, which will remain investors. The Albany, New York-based company had hired Morgan Stanley to explore options, including an initial public offering. “Everything was on the table,” said Chief Executive Officer Frank Poore. CommerceHub was taken private in 2018 when it was acquired for $1.1 billion by GTCR and Sycamore Partners. Its business has grown since then, Poore said. CommerceHub helps connect retailers like Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. with suppliers. The company works with more than 15,000 retailers, brands and distributors. The e-commerce surge resulting from the coronavirus pandemic has been a boon for CommerceHub, Poore said. “We’ve done exceptionally well this year,” he said, adding that about $25 billion in gross merchandise volume was transacted through CommerceHub in the past 12 months. In-store retail may take back some sales once businesses fully re-open, but not all of them, Poore predicts. “I would suspect that there will be some dip,” he said. “But I think a lot of these changes are permanent.”

OPEC+ was discussing a proposal to gradually ease its oil-output cuts next year, seeking to resolve divisions that emerged at the core of the cartel over several days of fractious negotiations. Talks were focused on a proposal for the cartel to add 500,000 barrels a day to the market in January, potentially to be followed by similar-sized supply hikes in subsequent months, delegates said. That would modify the current deal, which allows supply to jump by 1.9 million barrels a day from Jan. 1.

As long as international laws are complied with, they can be exported, the Environment Ministry said in a newspaper advertisement on Wednesday.

In 2008 at least six babies died and 300,000 fell ill after drinking made-in-China infant formula tainted with toxic chemicals. In response, many Chinese parents embraced foreign brands, catapulting the likes of Danone SA’s Aptamil and Nestlé SA’s Illuma to the top of the market. Yet for the past two years, the leading formula brand in China has been made by China Feihe Ltd., a Beijing company that emphasizes its local roots rather than seeking to obscure them. “More suitable for Chinese babies,” the company’s advertising boasts. In categories ranging from baby food and bottled water to sportswear and skin cream, Chinese brands are putting pressure on global rivals that depend on the country for much of their growth. While increasing nationalism has boosted the momentum of domestic products for the past couple of years, the Covid-19  pandemic is hastening the shift. With prices typically lower than foreign brands’, domestic products have increasing appeal in times of constrained household budgets, and the growth of online sales has weakened the multinationals’ advantages in distribution and marketing. “Chinese shoppers are showing stronger confidence in local brands,” says Helen Wong of Qiming Venture Partners, which has backed local startups such as lingerie maker Neiwai and cafe chain Coffee Box. “The coronavirus is accelerating the trend as people stay home, watch livestreaming, and shop.” Investors have piled into domestic companies that are overtaking multinational rivals, doubling the combined value of China’s 500 top brands in the past four years to about $3.8 trillion, according to marketing consultancy World Brand Lab. Clothing and shoe manufacturer Anta Sports Products, which in 2018 passed Nike to become China’s No. 2 sports apparel brand behind Adidas, is up more than 50% this year even as the benchmark Hang Seng index has fallen 6%. Shares of China’s biggest bottled water brand, Nongfu Spring, have more than doubled since its September Hong Kong trading debut. Yatsen Holding, owner of cosmetics house Perfect Diary, a growing threat to the likes of L’Oréal and Estée Lauder, has jumped 75% since its U.S. initial public offering in November. Percentage-point change in market share, 2010 to 2019 Data: Euromonitor International  Local names account for seven of the top 10 cosmetics brands, up from just three in 2017, according to market researcher Daxue Consulting. L’Oréal SA’s Maybelline makeup line has seen its share in China plunge, to 9.1% last year from more than 20% in 2010, according to Euromonitor International. In the skin care and lotion category, the share of L’Oréal Paris dropped, to 4.5% last year from 5.6% in 2014, putting it neck and neck with local brand Pechoin. The growing strength of Chinese cosmetics makers can be traced to their smart online strategy, according to Derek Deng, a partner in Shanghai with Bain & Co. “Insurgent Chinese brands are more likely to be digital from Day One,” he says, while multinationals tend to favor physical stores. Perfect Diary, launched in 2017, now stands just behind several European-owned brands, with 4% of the crowded market for so-called color cosmetics such as lipstick and mascara, Euromonitor estimates. Its advertising stresses that its products come from the same manufacturers as Dior, Lancôme, and Armani but sell for less than one-third the price. It’s teamed with Mondelez International’s Oreos for a skin foundation cream (no, it doesn’t contain ground-up cookies; the box looks like an Oreo). On Singles Day, the Nov. 11  shopping palooza organized by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Perfect Diary’s online store included livestreams of influencers pitching products such as animal-themed eye shadow (co-branded with the Discovery Channel) featuring colors and packaging inspired by rabbits, deer, and fish. “We’ve proven we can stand out in a highly competitive market,” says David Huang, chief executive officer of Yatsen. Foreign brands aren’t finished in China, of course. They dominate categories such as high-end handbags and luxury cars. Estée Lauder Cos. sold more than 2 billion yuan ($300 million) of products on Singles Day with a livestreaming campaign, two-for-one discounts, and installment payment plans. And KFC—still the biggest fast-food chain in China—is supplementing its fried chicken with products such as fast-cooking stinky sour snail noodles to cater to diners stuck at home in the pandemic. “The attitude of big international brands is changing significantly,” says Wu Wenmi, founder of Wenzihui MCN, an agency in Hangzhou that partners with Alibaba. “They are more humble now and willing to hear our opinions of how to play the game.” One way Chinese companies are playing the game is with marketing that resonates for locals. While foreigners’ ads stress the nutritional value of their infant formula, Feihe nurtures relationships with consumers via loyalty programs, new-parent support groups, and collections of bedtime stories. And Chinese brands are increasingly tailoring their wares to domestic tastes. China Mengniu Dairy Co., for instance, is stepping up sales of innovations such as pineapple-flavored cheese and squid-infused snacks in addition to its lineup of basic milk and fruit yogurts. “Foreign brands were so innovative three decades ago when they first came to China,” Mengniu CEO Lu Minfang said at a November media briefing. “But now they’re developing slower than local brands.” —Bruce Einhorn and Daniela Wei

Iran’s top political chamber gave final approval to a bill forcing President Hassan Rouhani to end international nuclear inspections unless the U.S. lifts key sanctions by February, giving the incoming Biden administration just weeks to make a diplomatic breakthrough. The new legislation also says that Iran will immediately take measures to start producing 20% enriched uranium for peaceful purposes and increase its stockpile of the fissile material, potentially reducing the time Iran needs to make preparations to acquire a weapon.

China’s loosening of control over capital markets is being accompanied by tougher oversight of companies that previously faced little regulation. Under President Xi Jinping, authorities appear keen to push ahead with reforms to give markets greater sway. The measures will encourage inflows while making the economy leaner and more efficient, thus strengthening the country against a more hostile world. But greater opening also makes it more likely investors will pile into a small number of very profitable companies, mostly in the private sector. Such clustering could create imbalances in the financial system, as well as make some companies too powerful.

The Covid-19 pandemic was barely underway in the U.S. when life insurance companies started wrestling with whether to sell new policies to people who survived the virus. The Delaware Department of Insurance started seeing it in June. Companies filed requests to change their application forms to specifically ask applicants if they’d had Covid-19. The Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission—which uses a uniform set of standards to regulate insurance products for 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico—has approved 32 such requests since March. It’s also known as the Insurance Compact.

Forward oil prices once again strengthened in ways that indicate both tighter physical availability of crude, but also a brighter outlook for consumption once vaccines against Covid-19 start to take effect. The nearest December Brent futures are now trading at a higher level than the same contracts for December 2022, surging to the highest premium since February on Thursday. The structure, known as backwardation, signals expectations for a tighter supply-demand balance next year. That can be seen in the marked flattening of the oil futures curve over recent weeks.

One of the year’s biggest spikes in Treasury yields has investors mapping out the impact of rising rates on markets ranging from stocks to corporate bonds. Renewed optimism about U.S. stimulus talks pushed the benchmark 10-year yield to a high of 0.96% on Wednesday, a move which if continued could spark a domino effect across risk assets trading at all-time highs thanks to low interest rates. At issue is whether the jump in yields is accompanied by an economic recovery and moderate levels of inflation that would allow the Federal Reserve to keep rates low.

Sales of digital games fell 10% year-over-year between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, largely the result of shortages of new consoles from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp., according to research firm SuperData. Many gamers appear to be waiting to buy the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles before purchasing titles, SuperData said Wednesday. Console-game revenue fell 13% during the typically strong sales weekend, though gains in PC games helped offset the decline. Overall game spending is still on track for a record in 2020, the firm said.

Salesforce.com Inc.’s $27.7 billion takeover of Slack Technologies Inc. represents co-founder Marc Benioff’s most aggressive effort yet to challenge reigning software maker Microsoft Corp. The cash-and-stock deal, announced Tuesday and expected to close by July, will bring a workplace-communications application that’s grown more popular during the coronavirus pandemic to Salesforce’s ever-expanding platform. In the process, the app maker will come into greater conflict with the world’s largest software company, which offers a competing product named Teams. The purchase of Slack, an existing partner with less than $1 billion in annual revenue, fulfills Benioff’s long-held goal to make Salesforce’s software relevant to a broad swath of corporate employees, beyond the marketers and account representatives who log on to the company’s programs each day. At stake is the chance for Salesforce, a maker of cloud-based apps for managing customer relationships, to elevate itself to the very top of the software industry. Benioff has what he calls a “$50 billion dream” for Salesforce’s annual revenue, which would surpass every maker of business applications short of Microsoft. The chairman and chief executive officer, who has been the overseer or architect of more than 60 deals since his company’s start in 1999, is getting something he has sought for more than a decade -- a transformational communications asset. He’s also further cementing Salesforce as Microsoft’s chief rival in business applications. “This moment is one we will remember a couple decades from now,” Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield said Wednesday during an appearance at Salesforce’s annual user conference. He likened the deal to the debut of Microsoft’s Windows 95 and the emergence of the cloud. “This is a pivotal moment and the opportunity to really transform the way that we work so we’re not relying on the physical office, so we can have a digital HQ,” Butterfield said. Salesforce investors, however, were skeptical of the deal and the company’s stock fell 8.6% to $220.57 at 3:05 pm in New York. Analysts questioned the high price and necessity of the takeover, which came amid slowing revenue growth. The stock had climbed 48% this year through Tuesday’s close. Read more: Salesforce Agrees to Buy Software Maker Slack for $27.7 Billion The transaction, which is Salesforce’s priciest and one of the biggest acquisitions this year, isn’t something Benioff had planned to do during the pandemic. But he said the deal could reshape the software landscape and projected bravado that Salesforce had met its moment. “We’re going to help them to just redefine the entire industry,” Benioff said of Slack during a conference call with analysts. “When the moment and the opportunity arises, you have to look and ask yourself, are you strong? Can you do something like this? Or are you weak? Or is it a moment where you just don’t have the swagger? And let’s face it. Look at these numbers we just delivered. Salesforce has never been stronger, never been more capable, it’s never had a more competitive position.” Microsoft’s Teams product, which hosts videoconferences, offers a workplace chatroom and provides automation tools, is a top competitor to Slack. Salesforce will inherit the rivalry, which has grown acrimonious, with Slack complaining about Microsoft to regulators. Salesforce and Microsoft themselves have had a turbulent relationship in the past several years. Benioff was one of the first rivals Satya Nadella forged closer ties with when he took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014, but the executives’ relationship fractured in 2016 when Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft acquired the social network for professionals, LinkedIn. Nadella beat Benioff to the asset and reinforced Microsoft’s intention to compete fiercely with Salesforce’s main business. LinkedIn would have complemented Salesforce’s sales-tracking product and boosted its profile. The San Francisco-based company unsuccessfully urged European nations to block the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal on antitrust grounds. The freeze thawed somewhat last year when Salesforce and Microsoft signed a new cloud partnership. Now another acquisition, this one by Salesforce, adds a new dimension to the rivalry. “Slack is probably a bigger threat to Microsoft in some ways than Salesforce is because Slack’s use case hits at the heart of Microsoft’s information worker’s productivity suite,” said Gregg Johnson, a former Salesforce executive and the CEO of Invoca Inc., which uses artificial intelligence to help businesses track and analyze customer conversations. “That’s like the jewels in the crown of Microsoft. Dominating the information worker is how Microsoft has printed money for 25 years.” That market dominance explains why Microsoft has been so “aggressive” in rolling out Teams, he added. In July, Slack asked European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft, claiming it unfairly foists Teams software on millions of users by distributing it for free with its Office cloud product suite. Read more: Slack is Gossipy Email That Plays Into All Our Bad Habits Microsoft entered Slack’s business in 2017 after considering an acquisition of Slack and opting instead to build Teams. As of Oct. 28, Teams had 115 million daily active users, up from 75 million in April. Slack has said it has a different way to define a daily active user than Microsoft, and prefers to disclose usage metrics that highlight engagement. In March, the company said more than 12.5 million people were using its app simultaneously, which was a record. “Everyone is feeling Microsoft’s dominance in the space,” Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research, said in an interview. “This deal is going to help Slack grow in a way it hasn’t before.” Benioff’s company and Microsoft already compete in the market for software that salespeople use to manage their deal pipelines. Microsoft’s offering is called Dynamics 365. They also vie for clients trying to improve productivity with Microsoft’s Office 365 and Salesforce’s Quip, an acquired product that is a market laggard. Salesforce’s last record deal, about $15 billion for Tableau last year, was an attempt to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft in analytics software and business intelligence. In effect, Salesforce has been encircling its larger foe, replicating its footprint to tap into greater growth opportunities. So far, the strategy has been effective. Salesforce projected that its revenue could reach as much as $25.6 billion in the next fiscal year, almost double the company’s performance in the fiscal year that ended about two years ago. “With Tableau, Salesforce could sell to more general data analysts,” Elman said. “Slack takes it to a whole other level. Everyone in an organization can use Slack.” While Slack has grown steadily during the pandemic, its share price has gained modestly relative to peers this year because of weak billings from small and mid-sized clients and concern about the amount of traction that Microsoft Teams was gaining. Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor organized the deal with Slack’s Butterfield before pitching Benioff on the idea. “What’s very exciting is this vision that Stewart and Bret have put together,” Benioff said in a conference call. “It’s a wow.” Taylor, who sold his company, Quip, to Salesforce, said Slack will be deeply integrated with the app maker’s software suite to help its customers’ employees. “It really is about facilitating this all-digital, work-from-anywhere world, to enable team selling, to enable people in a contact center to swarm on a case digitally whether or not you’re in the same building, to enable marketers to plan a campaign,” Taylor said. This pitch aligns with Benioff’s goal for his company to play a big role in office communications -- an ambition that has so far failed to materialize. The same year that Slack was founded, in 2009, Salesforce debuted a similar tool called Chatter at its annual user conference. A messaging platform, Chatter features groups that are like Slack channels, with comment threads and file-sharing capabilities. Salesforce bought a Super Bowl ad in 2011 that featured a cartoon version of recording artist Will.i.am trying to get viewers to go to chatter.com, with a requisite cameo from Fergie. Salesforce would include a version of Chatter with every user license, but a decade later, the service hasn’t spurred much conversation. “Marc has always had a vision for having Salesforce ultimately touch all employees in a company, not just people in sales, service and marketing,” said Johnson, who served as vice president of product management for Chatter from 2010 to 2013. “We never achieved that goal with Chatter. Chatter was still largely a tool for sales, service and marketing users, whereas Slack has achieved mass-market adoption across every department of a company.” Salesforce and Slack said that once their combination is complete, they’ll “create the operating system for the new way to work,” which sounded like a veiled reference to Microsoft, maker of the most popular operating system for personal computers. — With assistance by Dina Bass

Pennsylvania Republicans who sued to block additional steps to certify the state’s election results claim there’s a “reasonable possibility” the U.S. Supreme Court will take up their long-shot appeal and a “fair prospect” the justices will rule in their favor. Republican plaintiffs led by U.S. Representative Mike Kelly on Wednesday asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to grant an emergency delay of its ruling allowing state officials to complete their certification of results in favor of President-elect Joe Biden and other candidates. They said the status quo needed to be preserved while they try to appeal their case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

U.S. stocks retreated from record highs just before the close of trading to finish little changed after a report briefly spurred confusion over the Covid vaccine roll out.  The S&P 500 ended in the red, while the Nasdaq Composite managed to close at an all-time high. The benchmark S&P spent most of the session at a record before a report that identified supply chain problems behind a previously disclosed slowdown in Pfizer Inc.’s production plans for its vaccine. Sentiment also weakened after California said it will lock down its economy if critical-care units reach capacity. Small caps outperformed as the reopening rotation continued.

Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly was sworn in to the U.S. Senate Wednesday afternoon, shrinking the Republican majority and likely dooming President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judy Shelton to the Federal Reserve. Republicans now hold a 52-48 majority in the chamber. Since three Republicans oppose Shelton and no Democrats support her, any hope of confirming her this year depends on enough of those senators being absent. Trump could nominate Shelton again next year, but the new Congress would have just a few legislative days to act before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.

President Donald Trump is trying to “seize” Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes through a bogus lawsuit after losing the state to President-elect Joe Biden, Governor Tony Evers said in a court filing hours after being sued. Trump and his re-election campaign have asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reverse the certification of Biden’s victory in the state, claiming that more than 200,000 mail-in ballots were illegally counted. The attempt to overturn the will of the voters is an “assault on democracy,” Evers, a Democrat, said in a filing responding to the suit late Tuesday.

Mortgage investors will carry unpleasant memories of this year’s surging prepayment speeds, yet as the calendar flips there appears little chance of near-term relief. The 30-year mortgage rate is at 2.72%, a record low, and for the most credit-worthy borrowers the rate is oftentimes even less. This has driven prepayment speeds on Fannie Mae 30-year mortgage bonds 117% higher year-to-date -- their fastest since at least 2004. Speeds on Ginnie Mae 30-year bonds have increased 52% over the same time frame, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Welcome to Wednesday, Europe. Here’s the latest news and analysis from Bloomberg Economics to help you start the day:
European Central Bank policy maker Martins Kazaks said an expansion of the institution’s emergency bond-buying program by 500 billion euros ($603 billion) would be “reasonable” and he’s ready to support an extension until mid 2022. The resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic in the euro area and the likely negative impact on economic growth next year mean that the ECB needs to continue to provide support, the governor of Latvia’s central bank said in an interview from Riga. Officials are set to decide on how to boost stimulus on Dec. 10.

Canadian airlines haven’t gotten much of what they asked for from Justin Trudeau during the pandemic. With airports nearly empty, they’re now pinning their hopes on a testing experiment to convince the prime minister to relax some of the world’s strictest Covid-19 travel rules. A new program in the western province of Alberta is testing international travelers for the virus on arrival. Participants who receive a negative result are allowed to get back to a near-normal life in about two days, though a second test is required several days later. Everyone else entering Canada must quarantine for 14 days, a rule that has not changed since March.

A band of 30 finance executives sat in silence on the ice, their eyes closed. With no sound but the Arctic wind and the occasional creaking of snow boots, some began to weep as they contemplated the consequences of global warming—both for the glaciers around them  and the entire world. This unusual subzero meditation was a defining moment in an expedition aimed at connecting executives from the biggest Dutch banks, insurers, and fund managers with the devastating realities of climate change. Anita de Horde, a sustainable finance manager who together with a polar explorer led the 2018 voyage to the Svalbard archipelago between Norway and the North Pole, says the financial sector has a responsibility to act—and the resources to do so.

The U.K.’s quick approval of the Covid vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE means Britons will get first dibs on a shot developed in two other countries -- the U.S. and Germany. Britain’s drug regulator on Wednesday cleared the vaccine for emergency use, ahead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its European Union counterpart. The government cited a rule allowing the U.K. to authorize a shot independently before the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31. An accelerated review process in which regulators were able to monitor Pfizer’s trial data in real time also helped.

Construction startup  Katerra Inc. is shutting down, according to a person familiar with the matter, a dramatic collapse for a company that raised about $2 billion from investors including SoftBank Group Corp. Katerra, founded in 2015, had promised to  shake up the construction industry with its efficient factories, prefab parts and modular construction units. The company has said it was working in countries including the U.S., India and Saudi Arabia. In February of last year, Katerra’s marketing materials touted 8,000 employees across the globe. With major cash infusions from SoftBank and others, Katerra grew quickly, in part by acquiring smaller construction companies. But integrating those businesses  proved difficult, and the company was forced to deal with construction delays and issues in trying to perfect its modules. The person who described Katerra’s closing asked not to be identified because the information is private. In 2019, Katerra said it would cut 200 jobs, even after raising $865 million from investors the previous year. The company also shut down a factory in Phoenix, with the intention of focusing on a more highly automated facility in California. SoftBank declined to comment on the company’s dismantling. Representatives for Katerra did not respond to requests for comment. Tech news site The Information earlier reported the news. The demise of Katerra is a significant defeat for SoftBank, which had made a large bet on the startup’s transformative potential. In May, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son called out Katerra specifically as an investment where it had  made mistakes, along with WeWork and Greensill. WeWork saw its once-lofty valuation crater in 2019 as its attempt at an initial public offering fell apart. And supply-chain finance venture Greensill dramatically collapsed earlier this year. Son also said that SoftBank’s successes in startup investing outweighed its failures. — With assistance by Jackie Davalos

A bipartisan pair of U.S. senators are pushing for legislation to support local governments that expand their ability to deal with mental health-care emergencies, seeking to shift the responsibility away from the police. The bill, introduced by Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto and Texas Republican John Cornyn, would provide funding to expand mental-health services, including to the uninsured. It would also create a nationwide set of standards for running crisis hotlines, urgent care facilities, residential centers and mobile units that respond to behavioral crises. “The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the mental health challenges so many Americans are facing, and we need to act with urgency to protect vulnerable people experiencing behavioral health crises and provide them with the treatment and services they need to get healthy,” said Cortez Masto in an emailed statement. “I’ve heard from both law enforcement and civil rights leaders that we can’t rely on the same old system.” The legislation introduced Thursday reflects the broader effort nationwide to pivot away from relying on police as the first responders to mental health crises. The current approach is considered costly, time-consuming and can escalate into deadly encounters. New York City is  running a pilot program that sends emergency medical and mental health care workers instead of police in some instances. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Chicago and Greenville, North Carolina are trying programs of their own. The efforts are modeled in part after a  30-year-old program in Eugene, Oregon, that routes calls involving non-violent substance abuse, homelessness or mental health issues to a team made up of one EMS officer and one social worker. Those teams typically work alone, only calling police for backup in 1% of cases. That type of shift is intended to help prevent people in mental health crises from encounters like those that resulted in police shootings in Rochester, Philadelphia and Boston.  Read more: ‘All the Systems Failed’: Mental Health, Police and Deadly Risks Having individual elements of a behavioral health system is a start, but mobile teams, urgent care and post-care facilities must work together and be interlinked for success, according to a March report from the National Council for Behavioral Health. Funding under the federal bill would come through a block grant program for qualifying state, local and community programs that meet the national standards set out in the legislation. Since last year, as part of the American Rescue Plan and supplemental funding, mental health programs received $3 billion in grants from the federal government. The exact scale of the funding to be provided isn’t set by the bill. The legislation would mark the first attempt to create a funding mechanism that would be paired with national standards for this kind of care. So far, efforts have been piecemeal and city-specific, meaning for individuals in crisis, the experience can be akin to punishment rather than care, said David Covington, the chief executive officer of RI International, which designs crisis service efforts nationwide. A combination of the calls for social justice in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, the pandemic and the potential for cost savings has helped galvanize support in the space, Covington added. “We’re at an inflection point,” he said. “For the first time in my lifetime we’re seeing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Medicare leadership, members of Congress and the Biden administration talking about mental health care.”

Germany cut its Covid-19 risk level to “high” from “very high” in the latest sign that the coronavirus pandemic is loosening its grip on Europe’s largest economy. After raising its contagion warning in December, the Robert Koch Institute -- the country’s public health authority -- is lowering it on Tuesday, according to Health Minister Jens Spahn. The move is a sign of lower infections and fewer people with the virus in intensive care, he said.

In the chronically underfunded U.S. child care sector, staff turnover has always been a problem — but never quite like this.“It’s unprecedented, which has been used a lot this year, but it’s true,” says Carol Murray, 55. “I don’t think my industry has seen anything quite like it before.” Murray directs the Abigail Lundquist Botstein Nursery School, an early childhood program at Bard College at Annandale-on-Hudson in New York, which takes care of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds and operates a pop-up program for elementary school kids to accommodate half-days during partial school reopenings. Her school, and industry, are currently experiencing a now-familiar pandemic-era trial: a major labor crunch.  “We’re competing with many markets now,” she says. “Chipotle is paying $16.50 an hour, the service industry is upping their game because they’re facing shortages. With child care, it’s very difficult to hold on to someone.” Conversations with experts and analysis of child care requests across the U.S. suggest that finding qualified workers is a significant challenge, right as school gets out for the summer and more parents begin returning to the office. A study in New Hampshire in April found roughly one in eight of the state’s licensed child care spots was unfilled due to staffing shortages; locations from Bloomington, Illinois, to Columbus, Ohio, to Missoula, Montana, have been struggling to keep up with demand for months.  “From what I’m hearing from directors, staffing is challenge A, B, C, and D,” says Elliot Haspel, a child care policy expert and author of Crawling Behind: America's Child Care Crisis and How to Fix It. “Child care was already having issues before with staffing, and this will make it so much worse. This means parents will have less options, and some programs will have a budgetary death spiral. It’s truly an existential crisis.” A Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis shows that the child care workforce is down 15% from pre-pandemic to now, a significant challenge for the 16% of the overall workforce — or 26.8 million people — who depend on child care to work. Roughly 35% of child care workers were laid off in the early stages of the pandemic, says Rasheed Malik, senior policy analyst for Early Childhood Policy for the Center for American Progress (CAP), and only about half of those have returned in the last nine months.  There were hopes that more workers would come back as states prioritized child care workers for early vaccinations, but re-hiring has lagged. Malik believes that in an uncertain economy — with workers unsure they want to return to low-wage jobs and incentives offered in other industries — the staffing dilemma has become worse. Part of the problem comes from a dramatic demand shift. Winnie, an online platform for finding child care, analyzed requests for care between February 2020 and 2021 among its network of 200,000 locations, and found a striking disparity between suburban and urban locations. Demand for open slots in child care centers had dropped in downtowns and big cities, meaning a big jump in available capacity, while many wealthy suburbs have seen demand for care skyrocket, shrinking capacity. Child care is a slow-moving, highly regulated industry — one can’t simply open up a new location overnight — so even small demand and population shifts disrupt a tenuous equilibrium.  “In suburban markets, families are searching, but new supply doesn’t exist, so it’s harder to get a spot,” says Sara Mauskopf, CEO of Winnie.   The shifts were consistent across the nation’s 10 largest metros; demand for care was down in urban centers and downtowns, and sharply up in more-distant suburban areas. (In the Bay Area, however, there was lower demand in urban and suburban locations across the board.) Take the Chicago metro area; in the city and Evanston, a neighboring suburb to the north with a large student population, the demand-to-supply ratio plunged 236% and 120%, respectively, while in areas further from the city, such as Naperville and Bolingbrook, it grew 57% and 52%.  The analysis makes sense to CAP’s Malik. In cities, child care near commercial centers might be harmed by the rise of remote work. More young families were induced to make the move to suburbia all at once, flooding a system that takes time to staff up. A reshuffle of young families in the ’burbs would make it hard to find care, on top of reduced capacity due to Covid restrictions and staffing shortages.  Murray saw this dynamic at play at Bard: The Hudson Valley saw an influx of Manhattanites during the pandemic. “All the real estate that’s been sitting for 20 years with for sale signs are gone,” she says. That means more families, and more kids, flooding what she calls a child-care desert. When she reopened in the summer after closing in March, she received three or four emails a day requesting child care. Now they have a longer waiting list than they’ve ever had.  She is in a better position than many in her industry. Because her program is connected to Bard College, which sees investment in child care as a way to retain workers, she can pay more than several other area employers: Starting wages of $13 or $14 an hour were bumped to $18 this spring (the nation’s median pay for child care workers is $12.24, and a national study found that half of child care workers are on means-tested public support like SNAP food aid). Often, she’s hiring workers without the traditional background or experience, so the center invests significant resources in training and onboarding. Even with the extra wages, holding on to staff is a challenge as wages rise elsewhere. “Our hands are tied, and we don’t have a budget to sustain a profession that needs high-quality professionals,” she says. Pandemic-era conditions have made these challenges even more daunting. Nobody at her facility came down with Covid-19, but a series of quarantines left the center short-staffed for multiple 14-day periods, and a handful of her workers needed to take time off to care for family members. “We didn’t get hero pay, and what we need teachers to do now is harder than it’s ever been before,” Murray says. “When you say essential worker, what’s more essential than watching kids?”  “I don’t think it’s fully appreciated yet. Where are they going to get workers now? Who is going to work at a child care center?” As the industry faced dire straits due to a lack of income in 2020 and early 2021, the CARES Act ($4.25 billion), December stimulus ($10 billion) and American Rescue Plan ($39 billion) sent significant funding to help buttress the child care providers, allowing the industry to bend and not break, said Haspel. Hundreds of programs across the country did close during this stabilization process, and many have emerged financially fragile.  “The big question moving forward is staffing and sustainable funding,” said Haspel. “These programs survived, but we need more for them to thrive going forward.” There’s not enough evidence that the current geographical mismatch between supply and demand disruption is permanent, he says, or that there’s been a fundamental demand shift. This fall, in what is hoped to be a relatively normal school year, will be a big test, especially if employers push for a return to the in-person office.  The more challenging, and long-term, issue is wages for child care workers, who are low-paid and mostly women, especially women of color. More competitive wages are needed to keep pace with employers such as Amazon and Walmart, which are raising base compensation. Child care centers are mostly small businesses that operate on razor-thin margins, and often can’t afford to raise prices. “If the option is to make $10 an hour without health care at the child care center, or $14 an hour with benefits in retail, that’s a problem,” said Haspel. “I don’t think it’s fully appreciated yet. Where are they going to get workers now? Who is going to work at a child care center now?” There are legislative fixes being debated at the federal level. President Joe Biden has proposed the American Families Plan, which would invest in teacher training and ensure a $15 minimum wage for workers in the industry, a needed boost with current average pay hovering around $12. Meanwhile, the Child Care for Working Families Act, co-sponsored by Senator Patty Murray of Washington and Virginia Representative Bobby Scott, who reintroduced it last month, is designed to make pointed investments in the wages of child care educators and ask states to develop models to figure out what they should pay child care workers to get a minimum level of quality, says Malik.  “Quality was suffering because the best people couldn’t afford to work those jobs,” he said. An analysis by CAP found that more than 76% of families, covering nearly 10 million children, would be eligible for free or reduced-cost child care if the act passes; 2 in 3 families would have their costs capped at less than 4% of household income, and more than half of eligible children being covered for free.  “The underlying conditions that made this system so susceptible to a crisis like this need to be fixed,” says Malik. “Pre-pandemic, high-income families were four times as likely to get high-quality child care for their kids as low-income families, the results of decades of inaction. It’s a level of cost that’s not even anticipated by many young parents.” Malik calls this moment, after so much economic struggle, a “once-in-a-generation” chance to change. For Haspel, it’s a sign that the nation can’t rest on the laurels of the rescue funding. It’s helpful, but won’t prevent these kinds of shocks to the system from happening again; the market, he believes, can’t solve this.  “People are exhausted,” said Murray. “There’s an emotional component of wearing a mask all day. I had teachers coming to work a lot crying and depressed, telling me my husband lost his job, my teenager is struggling with school, my mom got Covid. Teachers are people who care, and a lot of other people rely on them in their families. Teachers were doing amazing work, but crumbling.”

Schools in England reopened in March after being closed for two months during the third national lockdown. Virus restrictions meant most pupils only had one full term of lessons in the classroom since coronavirus hit the U.K. early last year.

With coronavirus variants sweeping the globe, the World Health Organization has devised a less technical way of describing them than their scientific, number-heavy names -- using the Greek alphabet.  Deploying letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma -- instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 -- to refer to the variants will make it “easier and more practical” to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. The organization convened a group of scientists to consider easy-to-pronounce and non-stigmatizing labels for the virus strains, which it divides into categories as “of interest” and “of concern.”

The Bank of Russia’s net foreign assets surged to an all-time high in May as Saudi Arabia’s slumped to the lowest in over a decade in April.

In contrast, Saudi Arabia dipped into its reserves to finance the deficit during the pandemic and has transferred billions to its sovereign wealth fund, which has been on a buying spree.
